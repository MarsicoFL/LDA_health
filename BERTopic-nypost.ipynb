than a month ago according to data presented by the canadian epidemiologist who spearheaded the world health organization s coronavirus mission to china fewer than new cases are reported daily down from a peak of subsequent countries will follow this same pattern in what s called farr s law first formulated in and ignored in every epidemic hysteria since the law states that epidemics tend to rise and fall in a roughly symmetrical pattern or bell shaped curve aids sars ebola they all followed that pattern so does seasonal flu each year clearly flu is vastly more contagious than the new coronavirus as the who has noted consider that the first known coronavirus cases date back to early december and since then the virus has afflicted fewer people in total than flu does in a few days oh and why are there no flu quarantines because it s so contagious it would be impossible as for death rates as i first noted in these pages on jan you can t employ simple math as everyone is doing and

attention and don t get counted in the caseload furthermore those calculating rates ignore the importance of good health care given that the vast majority of cases have occurred in a country with poor health care that s going to dramatically exaggerate the death rate the rate also varies tremendously according to age with a chinese government analysis showing percent deaths below age but percent above a study published last month in the journal of the american medical association found zero deaths worldwide among children and under zero like the flu the coronavirus is afflicting high risk

wondering why it was being held the coronavirus pandemic is rattling the world and daily life in america is changing at the blink of an eye does anything else matter and do we really need to hear what joe biden and bernie sanders have to say about it it turns out we didn t because neither man said anything significantly new or insightful on the topic nonetheless the debate turned out to be important and anyone who sat through what often seemed like the longest two hours in television was rewarded the pain was not in vain by the end biden had proved decisively why he s more deserving to be the democratic nominee it was far and away his best debate yet sanders meanwhile proved why he s got a cult following and will never have anything more at every opportunity he saddled up his hobby horse of medicare for all and rode it into the ground he s obsessively single minded and that s not a compliment even worse he made no attempt to hide his hatred for the nation despite the fact that we are under siege at one point sanders said the current crisis proved we had to rethink america because we are rotten with greed and corruption he also made the extraordinary charge that there s a bunch of crooks running the pharmaceutical industry and that they are saying oh what an opportunity to make a fortune it was a despicable attack on the american companies that employ hundreds of thousands of people and are pitching in to help save lives has sanders ever helped anybody but himself i find nothing admirable in a man who has spent his entire adult life denying the greatness of america while getting rich in the process remember he s a socialist with three homes for his part biden made only a few minor gaffes and there were no obvious brain freeze or cringe worthy moments it had to be reassuring to his supporters and donors that he was focused and consistently made solid relevant arguments overall he played it safe while still drawing important contrasts he repeatedly chided sanders for bringing up medicare for all saying this was an emergency and we needed to do things quickly to help people not try to fight a revolution this is like a war and being attacked from abroad this is like a war biden said another time he noted that italy had a single payer system of the kind sanders wants and was suffering one of the worst outbreaks of the deadly scourge in an obvious appeal to sanders supporters biden said they both wanted the same things starting with beating president trump they only differed biden said in the details and he cited sanders support for the gazillion dollar green new deal as another example no doubt the trump campaign will make sure voters know that biden thinks he and sanders share the same policy objectives including on fracking and immigration the best news of all is that we likely won t have to endure another democratic debate if biden as expected sweeps the table in the four big primary states voting tuesday sanders will have no argument for continuing his campaign the delegate lead would be insurmountable and four more defeats would prove that sanders has not expanded his base yet even as biden closes in on the nomination the political atmosphere like everything else is turning on its head for one thing trump looked to have a solid advantage with the expanding economy and low unemployment but now a recession is looking

joe hall for his overwhelming penalty minutes while playing for the canadiens just after world war i hall was on the team in when the stanley cup final between the canadiens and the seattle metropolitans was canceled hours before game when the winner was set to take home the cup too many players were hospitalized with the spanish flu including hall just weeks before his th birthday and four days after the game was canceled hall died of pneumonia hall became hockey s face of that pandemic from just over a century ago one that would kill tens of millions around the world that year stood as the only time the stanley cup was not awarded from its inception in until the nhl locked out its players and canceled the season now with the coronavirus pandemic spreading rapidly the nhl is in a pause phase facing the grim reality that the season is more likely to be canceled than restarted and so sarah hall kindly returned a message from a reporter when she had far greater things to think about she is an anesthesiologist at nanaimo regional general hospital in beautiful vancouver island british columbia her hospital had not received any patients suffering from covid as of saturday afternoon but she has seen all the graphs and projections and knows that it is coming sooner rather than later it felt like the calm before the storm and hall was just hoping to prepare herself and her hospital as well as she possibly could looking at our demographics they re projecting that we could need as many as ventilators hall told the post and we currently have if we include the ones we have in our operating room so yeah it s pretty dark hall is not much of a sports fan which she jokingly said made her a great disappointment to my family that s obviously not true as she was about to be on the front lines of a battle that mattered a lot more than anything with a silver chalice as a reward it s been really really busy hall said as with most hospitals we re in the center of preparing airway teams and trying to cobble together the equipment that we don t have just making a plan in all of the hubbub she has taken a little bit of time to think about her great grandfather whom she didn t know much about growing up but it was impossible to avoid the parallels between then and now even with greater worries swirling in everyone s mind it certainly has caused me to reflect upon his situation hall said but i m not sure that i can say that it s more strange it s just part of our history it is also part of the history of the stanley cup one that a lot of people don t know about that year the canadiens were the nhl champions and they were to take on the champion of the pacific coast hockey association pcha with the winner of the series getting the cup the two leagues played by different rules with seven players per side in the pcha and six per side in the nhl all the games were at the seattle ice arena and the metropolitans won games and in blowouts playing by their rules a combined score of while the canadiens won game and playing by their rules game was considered one of the best games in hockey history with georges vezina dazzling in the canadiens nets to keep it a scoreless match through two overtimes before it was called a draw it was played under nhl rules so game was considered a replay and played under the same rules thereafter it was determined that overtimes would go on until a goal was scored the mets were up but then frank foyston got hurt jack walker broke a skate and cully wilson collapsed from exhaustion according to the seattle post intelligencer they went on with only four skaters and the canadiens tied it before their substitute jack mcdonald sprinted onto the ice and won the game in overtime some players had to be carried off the ice and some went directly to the hospital along with hall the canadiens had five players in the hospital or bedridden along with owner george kennedy who would die two years later after being weakened by the flu his widow then sold the team for the two clubs decided to call off the series and in the league made an inscription on the cup under the year saying series not completed it s eerily similar sarah hall said there are a lot of parallels for sure back then the world was just coming out of war and would soon dive into a deep economic depression who knows what is going to happen now with the stanley cup or otherwise so sarah hall was planning for a mountain bike ride before getting back to work she rightfully said her home is a great place to be isolated but she knew that the lessons from the time of her great grandfather were not far behind so far so good hall said but i think we re bracing for what s yet to come',\n"," 'nigeria on sunday

health department to report potential or confirmed cases the excuse was that the lab would independently send a notification but this was plainly aimed at delaying any action proof of that comes from the shocking refusal last week to take the obvious steps after several educators at brooklyn tech tested positive for the covid bug the department of education still had all staff at one of the city s largest schools report in for work even though mayor bill de blasio had closed all schools for students this though the state education department on march ordered a complete shutdown of any infected school for at least hours for an investigation of who came into contact with students or staff members with a confirmed covid case nor was brooklyn tech the only case where carranza co ignored that

here the olympics after all have mostly known their place in world affairs the summer games were canceled because of world war i and both the summer and winter games of and were canceled due to world

still holding in person services is only because the ability to see the person and know they are dead is different than trying to convince yourself they are dead still we might put extra measures in place and put netting over the casket to make sure people don t touch the body and just to get some distance because you just don t know she said funeral director jonathan green of fairfield conn said

with the latter seen as a package deal with kevin durant and kyrie irving it begs the question of whether that leaves allen as a valuable reserve next season or as a valuable trade chip when the nets

their best admittedly keeping allen driven has been a thing for the nets even spencer dinwiddie said a dialed in allen is totally different when he comes with that aggressiveness he shows top type of

the tristate area a proposal that had thrown three governors for a loop including gov andrew cuomo who likened the plan to starting a civil war a quarantine will not be necessary trump wrote in a series of tweets saturday night reasoning that a travel advisory would suffice and the travel advisory was merely a tepidly worded announcement sans teeth buried in the cdc website the cdc urges residents of new york new jersey and connecticut to refrain from non essential domestic travel for days effective immediately it said the advisory stated it does not apply to such critical industries as trucking public health banking and food supply trump had said earlier saturday that he was considering imposing an enforced two week quarantine and travel ban on new york new jersey and parts of connecticut in hopes of protecting the rest of the nation from the epicenter of the outbreak we d like to see new york quarantined because it s a hot spot he said in a surprise announcement that blindsided cuomo who ripped the idea as a civil war kind of discussion the washington post via getty images this would be a declaration of war on states the governor said on cnn if you start walling off areas all across the country it would just be totally bizarre counter productive anti america anti social he said we would be wuhan china and that doesn t make any sense we don t have any details and aren t sure what the president means by his comment a city hall spokesperson weighed in new jersey gov phil murphy and connecticut gov ned lamont said they too had not been consulted by the white

remained the pandemic s hardest hit country with more than cases and some deaths those deaths represent a two day doubling in the death toll trump had divulged virtually no details of his proposed lockdown except to say it would exempt delivery trucks and vital personnel even so it would have been the biggest federal health quarantine since the spanish flu pandemic of according to the us centers for disease control and prevention i d rather not but we may need it trump had warned new york new jersey maybe one or two other places certain parts of connecticut quarantined the president spoke as he prepared to board his marine one helicopter en route to norfolk va where he oversaw the departure of the usns comfort hospital ship set to steam all day sunday toward new york harbor in threatening a lockdown trump singled out the risk to florida where state officials last monday ordered fleeing new yorkers to keep out or observe a mandatory day quarantine upon arrival all incoming planes from the tristate area are being boarded by law enforcement and state health officials under order of gov ron desantis governors in other states including maryland texas south carolina and rhode island have issued similar keep out or quarantine orders for fleeing new yorkers but trump s tristate lockdown would have been the first quarantine to be federally mandated they re having problems down in florida a lot of new yorkers going down we don t want that he said he doubled down later in the afternoon on a tarmac at andrews air force base calling a potential quarantine of new york new jersey and at least parts of connecticut short term two weeks restrict travel he said adding he has been in talks with desantis this would be an enforceable quarantine and you know i d rather not do it but we may need it eight hours passed with trump issuing no further clarifications on what the lockdown would entail or how it would be enforced neither did the white house we are evaluating those options now chief of staff mark meadows told reporters vaguely sen chuck schumer said he too was in the dark all decisions must be made based on facts science and the best advice from our public health professionals and it must be done in close coordination with our local and state officials i implore the president to work with new york officials follow the experts and make evidence based decisions the president would have been within his rights to issue an executive order mandating a quarantine in cases of communicable disease outbreaks including flu that can cause pandemic according to the cdc breaking a federal quarantine order could be punishable by fines and imprisonment the cdc says trump and cuomo have not been totally at odds earlier saturday cuomo noted with gratitude that the president had approved the opening of four new bed sites for coronavirus treatment also saturday cuomo announced that the state s presidential primary previously scheduled for april will now take

the coronavirus with estimates of over billion lost as jobs have been wiped out and more than million visitors stay away from the united states alone but with the storm clouds come a silver lining without the steady stream of cruise ships some of the worst polluters in the world the canals of venice have become clear for the first time in centuries pollution around the world has dropped dramatically and cities that had been trampled by overtourism are recovering and travel experts say that when the world recovers from the rampant spread of covid the industry will come back stronger than ever and when the world starts moving again it will be in the right way i think when this has finally come under control it will create a huge need to travel said samantha brown who hosts places to love on pbs and i m not talking just travel to far places but small trips to more local and state destinations we will want to move and most importantly reconnect to people pavia rosati who founded the travel site fathom agreed and said there will likely be an increased interest in local travel for those who want to stay relatively close to home this might be the year that new yorkers who usually go to greece make their way to nantucket or the gullah islands instead wherever people go there is sure to be a sense of mindfulness and appreciation for the local people and vibrant tapestries of cultures for the destinations we visit according to tom marchant co founder of luxury travel operator black tomato after weeks and perhaps months staying home this longing for authentic human connection and togetherness will be stronger than ever but there will be less of a cookie cutter travel mentality while cruise ships will always trundle on rosati hopes cities will cut down on mega mass tourism specifically in places like venice the italian government need s to start restricting the number of visitors allowed into the city daily she said and probably do a better job of restricting or even banning the floating mall sized cruise ships that disgorge tens of thousands of people into the city making its narrow streets un passable for venetians who are just trying to get home from work if this unwanted forced reset helps us get smarter about our limited resources and be a little less selfish about how we behave when we go out into the world we will come out of this crisis in a better place as the travel industry recovers travel options will be more limited than before the virus struck smaller destinations will likely not be as easily accessible one upside is that people will not take for granted the ease of travel and the freedom to explore so many places said melissa biggs bradley ceo and founder of indagare a boutique travel planning company there will be less over tourism but that is also going to be a consequence of fewer travel options which will have shrunk when we come out of this there is no way that you will have the quantity of flights or the range of flights when travel comes back i doubt that the smaller regional areas are going to have the same kind of flight lift that they had in early for another years airlines everywhere have been decimated and they are going to cut routes and many of the hotels and businesses that existed because of arriving tourists are going to disappear the limitations will help protect travel destinations from what bradley calls fast tourism like fast food quick travel that is not really nourishing or supportive of local communities she explained travel industry experts hope that the spread of covid will make travelers more aware of their surroundings with clean countries winning out once this pandemic is behind us big cities that were suffering under the weight of wall to wall tourist crowds will likely see fewer and smaller groups of travelers for a few years added wendy perrin who established the trusted travel expert s list poor rural communities that were devastated by the pandemic will probably see more donations from philanthropic minded travelers who visit these villages and want to help and countries such as singapore and south korea that implemented successful

it really makes it more of a challenge oppenheimer said of being unable to get an in depth look at players you haven t seen the player did he get stronger it makes it hard it s a little bit of a challenge while oppenheimer who is in his th year with the yankees and his scouts saw college players before games were shut down they might have to sort through information on players to make a pick with conviction rely on quality information and work with that oppenheimer said there is hope among the scouting community that even if colleges and high schools don t resume play there will be an avenue to get a live look at players before the draft which was originally scheduled for july but will be held sometime before july and likely will be five to rounds i think there will be stuff set up

sunday announced that federal social distancing guidelines would be extended to april in an effort to curb the coronavirus outbreak the initial day period of social distancing urged by the federal

house the us has more than cases of covid and at least deaths and the death toll is expected to peak in two weeks trump said trump had previously aimed to reopen the country on easter april but said sunday that was just an aspiration the mitigation methods aim to decrease the number of infections and deaths and the more people adhere to them the faster this nightmare will end trump said i want the american people to know that your selfless inspiring and valiant efforts are saving countless lives you are making the difference he said trump s announcement came as white house coronavirus task force member dr anthony fauci stood by a warning he d given earlier in the day on cnn that us deaths from the virus could be between and i think it s entirely conceivable that if we do not mitigate to the extent that we re trying to do that could reach that number it s possible he told reporters also at the briefing department of health and human services assistant secretary adm dr brett p giroir announced that self swab coronavirus tests will be rolled out next week it was a very big thing that the fda approved last week and it will now be implemented this week giroir said with the approval people with suspected cases of covid will be able to use a foam swab in their nose to collect a sample that they then put into a plastic bag for testing this would eliminate the need for health care workers to change their personal protective equipment every time they perform a test saving much needed resources instead of having a provider stick this all the way in the back of your nose that s uncomfortable but it also requires ppe changes every time it s done giroir said this not only increases the speed but it eliminates all those changes of ppe trump announced at the briefing that

to handle the growing coronavirus crisis there s still one major question who will operate them medical experts say gov andrew cuomo has said the state needs ventilators if hospitals get swamped with critically ill covid patients under the worst case scenario yet there are only a total of respiratory specialists licensed to operate the breathing machines in new york plus an unknown number of highly skilled nurses and doctors trained to use them i read that gov cuomo said that ventilators are to coronavirus what missiles were to world war ii while i am sure this is true you would not have grabbed a front line soldier off the battlefield put him in the fighter cockpit and expect him to fly the plane launch the missiles and defeat the enemy said anthony everidge a year veteran respiratory specialist who now works in nevada but is still licensed to operate in new york the outcome would be disastrous and would only compound the problem the analogy applies to ventilators and the successful operation and management of the mechanical ventilator he said everidge a member of the american association for respiratory care said he worries there will not be enough skilled respiratory therapists or doctors and nurses with knowledge to operate the ventilators based on the current number of licensed operators ventilators help gravely ill patients breathe by pumping air and oxygen into the lungs through a tube put in the nose or mouth to reach the windpipe the machine delivers more oxygen into the patient than any other method and also supplies pressure to keep the lungs open cuomo has discussed the need to stockpile ventilators if a crush of covid patients hits the hospital system in the next to days but he has spoken less about staffing the ventilators the governor during a press briefing sunday reported that health care workers including retirees have agreed to volunteer to help new york s strained medical facilities of that total he said were respiratory therapists the state health department did not dispute that staffing issues for ventilators is a challenge a health department spokesman referred the post to prior statements the governor has made about staffing issues you can create beds you find the equipment you have to have the staff cuomo said mayor bill de blasio also said sunday that he spoke to president trump about the need for ventilators and medical personnel he said city hospitals need at least ventilators the respiratory specialists are like nurses for respiratory care they monitor patients lung functions during their shifts by checking the data from the ventilator and adjusting the machine accordingly everidge said compounding the problem is that covid patients who are admitted to intensive care units are sicker than the typical patient who is intubated the typical patient is on a ventilator for three days but covid patients are hooked to a ventilator for anywhere from days to days with a high death rate cuomo said in a sign of the dire times the state last week approved the controversial practice of having two patients share a single ventilator it s not ideal cuomo said but we believe it s workable the northwell health system employs respiratory therapists at its regional hospitals including lenox hill long island jewish and staten island university hospitals a spokesman said there is

and medicine professor matt strauss cheers draconian measures to suppress covid through enforced social distancing which have already suppressed the outbreak in wuhan china and will likely achieve the same in the west in coming weeks and months but in the long term policymakers should aim to achieve herd immunity in a controlled and strategic manner lest the virus return with a vengeance once lockdown measures are lifted that would involve deploying widespread testing as germany and south korea have done plus exploiting the virus unique mortality profile people under are times less likely to die of covid than people over to gradually expose less vulnerable groups until herd immunity is achieved yes social distancing was necessary otherwise neither young nor old would have taken the

likely come out of good faith bargaining between desperate owners and beleaguered landlords than from various government relief proposals now being urged by restaurant business advocates the crisis is acute some sit down dining venues stand dark apart from the heartbreaking suspension of the big apple s essential noshing and socializing scene upward of local jobs are gone owners lost more than billion in revenue in four weeks takeout and delivery have failed to help much operators are scrambling to sell off t shirts and expensive vintage wine in a desperate bid to stay afloat there s no way to know when they ll be able to reopen or how many even including the big apple s most iconic names will survive esteemed chefs and owners including tom colicchio daniel boulud and danny meyer as well as the new york hospitality alliance correctly argue that the trillion federal stimulus bill included only crumbs for restaurants its payroll protection plan offers loans that are convertible to grants but that may be untenable for owners who d have to keep employees on the books without knowing when they ll reopen advocates want relief in various forms such as mandating insurance coverage for policies that don t include pandemics and several plausible cash infusion strategies they re well meant and important but the more enduring solution will likely involve the real estate free market even though at the moment the very idea of a free market is in limbo lease payments are a restaurant s most daunting fixed cost usually around percent of the total although often less than for operating costs such as labor food and supplies it s the toughest nut to crack because it s impossible to change a shuttered eatery can lay off its whole staff and spend nothing on food but is still on the hook for monthly rent how can owners such as havana central s jeremy merrin who pays million a year for his times square location afford that while having zero revenue he can t but then the sort of good news is that isn t a matter of charity for landlords to restructure restaurant tenant leases they have to pay mortgages insurance and taxes so they simply can t afford to evict a restaurant tenant even after gov andrew cuomo s three month moratorium on evictions is over this is as true for the family owners of a three story tenement in greenpoint as it is for a publicly traded real estate giant in midtown manhattan why because simply who would replace the restaurant when the entire us economy is frozen in place a shoe store they re closed too it s true that landlords have lots of debt but count on their lenders too to come to accommodations even if not contractually obligated to short term fixes might help restaurants in the very short term yet rent amelioration will matter much more when they re able to reopen whether current or future restaurants can afford to occupy their spaces will determine their futures but any legal mandates to forgive current rents require fast action by the state legislature and the governor and they have larger matters on their plates the hopeful news is that chaotic but likely productive dialogues between restaurateurs and landlords are under way the right path requires cooperation not confrontation eatery owners and property owners are in it together and need to work in everyone s mutual best interest progress is being made as reported by eater com the boqueria spanish tapas chain has already secured temporary rent waivers at many of its locations thanks to constructive talks with landlords and more landlords will follow suit or at least make some concessions it s better for the property owner than having more dark storefronts for which there s no tax break despite widespread misconceptions landlords and office tenants cooperated magnificently after the same thing can happen again for restaurants but only if all parties take the long term view otherwise the eateries will give up for good and leave their landlords in worse shape than they are',\n"," 'how do we reopen after the coronavirus goes away the mere question in the middle of the pandemic is fraught anyone entertaining the idea that businesses

for example in gov cuomo s directive to end non essential construction an exception is made for work done by a single worker who is the sole employee worker on a job site what about a job that requires two workers who can stay six feet apart there has to be a place to appeal for an exception another example gyms some may be able to reopen ahead of others a franchise owner at orange theory fitness told me the company invested in electrostatic cleaning sprays to disinfect between classes and that its equipment is three feet apart so clients could use every other station to maintain the required six foot distance could all gyms do that probably not but why must they all remain shut if some can function safely a lot of owners of non essential businesses point to so called essential

but the studies are worth the gamble in terms of the nyu clinical trial regarding prevention researchers are enrolling adult volunteers at six sites they are recruiting people who lack any covid symptoms but have been in close contact with others who have a confirmed or pending diagnosis on a random basis the trial participants will receive either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo pill vitamin

between jan and feb the white house official said the gear valued at nearly billion included more than billion masks and more than million protective clothing items that came from countries in the european union as well as australia brazil and cambodia the official said data from china s own customs agency points to an attempt to corner the world market in ppe like gloves goggles and masks

little good for the patients who are in the hospital on ventilators and might not have been there had they had access to ppe wessell also said that while china had recently begun easing exports of ppe they re using it for soft power essentially saying it s a humanitarian gesture to try to curry goodwill with american people when some of the problems we re facing are the direct result of chinese policies christian whiton a former senior diplomacy and trade adviser to the george w bush and trump administrations described chinese control of ppe as political warfare it looks like a coordinated effort between the chinese government and industry where they used to be nothing but exporters of this stuff but now they turned around and they re importing it while banning all exports said whiton

center tucked into the northern segment of the campus of st francis university in loretto pa there monday night the student school would celebrate the life of maurice stokes the school s most famous alumnus on the th anniversary of his death but god has his own plan says rev malachi van tassell the university s president so much about the extraordinary life of maurice stokes must be explained if it is to be explained at all by those six simple words he was a brilliant college player at st francis the first player to win the mvp at the nit from a team that didn t win the tournament in culminating a year in which he averaged points and rebounds he was the nba s rookie of the year in for the rochester royals became an all star when that franchise moved to cincinnati averaged points and rebounds and was well on his way at age to becoming one of the greatest players in the league s history but on march stokes fell and banged his head in the royals regular season finale a few days later on a small plane ride home from detroit for a playoff game he took ill by the time he reached the hospital he was fully paralyzed diagnosed with post traumatic encephalopathy he would regain some motor skills over the years through intense physical therapy but suffered a heart attack and died on april two months shy of his th birthday his funeral was held at st francis and he is buried on campus in the franciscan friar cemetery one of only a few lay people given their eternal rest there it is one of the heartbreaking stories in the history of american sports but also one of the most redeeming too thanks to stokes friendship with jack twyman twyman was a fellow all star on the royals and though the two men weren t especially close stokes accident changed that twyman lived year round in cincinnati stokes family was in pittsburgh soon after stokes diagnosis twyman agreed to become stokes legal guardian what followed was one of the extraordinary friendships ever formed one day jack was asked why he d decided to make such a remarkable commitment to maurice and again he shrugged his shoulders and said maurice needed someone i became that someone that phrase become that someone all these years later has become st francis motto and though st francis had to postpone its celebration of stokes life it is a message that has never seemed more relevant than it does in these turbulent uncertain days during this pandemic it s a call for each person to become their best self father van tassell says we can become that someone in any number of scenarios tim frank was hoping to be a part of the celebration frank is the nba s senior vice president for basketball communications and he is from altoona pa less than a half hour from st francis he grew up believing stokes was larger than life watched red flash basketball games in the fieldhouse named for stokes looked at his retired no in the rafters there one of the saddest elements of stokes story is that he played in the league so briefly and even among many basketball fans his is a name that often draws blank stares the nba did its part to rectify that eight years ago when it created the twyman stokes award to recognize the league s teammate of the year it is a poignant trophy one figurine helping another to its feet and the winners who have included chauncey billups tim duncan and vince carter are invariably honored at first and then completely humbled once they read up on the award s namesakes it s so gratifying to see that frank says more people should know about maurice and more people should know about the amazing friendship he had with jack especially now this is a story that resonates it does it should we lean on friends now as much as we ever have more even as much as maurice and jack leaned on each other once late in his life maurice s intense rehab yielded a small victory he was able to regain a little flexibility in his fingers it took him a few hours but he finally completed his first sentence on a typewriter he showed it to his friend dear jack how can i ever thank you to which jack immediately and quintessentially replied you may think i come here to cheer you

arbitration or free agency while games are not played the tigers are in a similar situation just substitute jordan zimmermann and miguel cabrera for cobb and davis while acknowledging that service time accruing for matt boyd is somewhat hurtful on the other side the dodgers are oft mentioned for being particularly hurt by games being missed and perhaps a season lost to the virus that revolves mainly around one player mookie betts he is due to be a free agent following the season regardless and now may never play a game for the dodgers after they traded three prospects to boston for him plus redirected kenta maeda to minnesota but the dodgers have the young talent and resources to remain a powerhouse even without the prospects or betts the lost revenue in the sport likely will drive down free agent prices at least for the near future and just a few teams such as the dodgers and yankees might have the finances to capitalize for the yankees though part of the tolerance to stretch to nine years at million for gerrit cole was knowing yeah they likely would be overpaying over the last few seasons of the contract but they also would be getting prime years early now cole s final season in his s is tick tick ticking away without games still the yankees have talent and resources and like the dodgers a baseball operations department that knows how to assemble a winning team the

they needed to spread payroll around more and deepen their stock of controllable talent but the cubs never traded those players who had two years of service time until free agency so now as their control is dwindling even as no games are being played their value is lower especially because more teams will lack the revenue to want to take on expensive players cubs president of baseball operations theo epstein told me last month the team would decide by the trade deadline if it could win a title and if not would be realistic about moving players will there even be a trade deadline now with the cubs facing the core of a champion bryant contreras javy baez jon lester anthony rizzo and kyle schwarber with expiring contracts after this season or next the reds already gave away two

marcus stroman and they did not make the playoffs last year stroman like bauer was obtained with his walk year in mind so either he will pitch less in his walk year or become a free agent without pitching at all the trade with the mariners already looking disastrous with kelenic growing into a top prospect while cano and diaz faltered last year can only be revived if the mets receive a lot out of cano and diaz as one nl executive said of what missing games does to that mets trade it takes an egregious screwup and makes it worse like bryant and contreras michael conforto steven matz and noah syndergaard all will be free agents after next season and the mets are now losing shrinking time with them syndergaard was going to miss this season one way or another after needing tommy john surgery but again like the cubs with bryant and contreras the mets have missed their best window to trade syndergaard and recoup some of the controllable inventory lost in the cano diaz and stroman deals also with no syndergaard and with stroman rick porcello and michael wacha free agents the mets rotation to begin is jacob degrom and matz and matz can leave the following offseason the strength of the team is about to not be that degrom turns in june like cole with the yankees the mets just don t want to lose out on any of degrom s peak one reason the mets could tolerate some expense and bad contracts is players such as pete alonso jeff mcneil and j d davis were not yet arbitration eligible the mets wasted a cheap season of that trio last year and another could be flitting away now if there is a season the good faith understanding between the union and mlb is that an attempt will be made to play as many games as possible that likely will necessitate adding doubleheaders and perhaps removing off days i would argue that the mets best through are as good as or better than that of any nl team except the dodgers and brodie van wagenen has made the mets a bit deeper than in recent seasons especially in the bullpen if dellin betances is healthy and diaz and jeurys familia rebound which was going to be key even in a game campaign submit questions on your favorite new york teams to be answered in an upcoming mailbag but depth is still an issue made worse already by the loss of syndergaard if teams are going to need to play more games in an abbreviated period depth is going to be more vital than ever and depth is not a mets strength one way to create depth if there is a partial season is to capitalize on an unfortunate situation that many teams bereft of revenue might have to move contracts even for middling return but does anyone see the mets adding to their payroll whenever i ask officials around the sport which teams are in the worst financial situation the mets routinely come up because they have so much debt and already were going to lose a lot trying to win in now also the value of a franchise the wilpons are trying to sell may be plummeting might the wilpons feel with steve cohen like the cubs with bryant and contreras that their best chance to receive the most for assets in this case a franchise came and went in the offseason what could financial distress mean for the near future the mets can get out of walk year players such as stroman yoenis cespedes jed lowrie wilson ramos justin wilson and even any non insurance payments to david wright after but will the lack of revenues this year even with a partial season and especially with none force the mets to take their payroll down toward million or less as one personnel head said their track record is not wanting to spend even in good times in which case can they even make a qualifying offer roughly million to stroman would they even tender a contract to syndergaard about million if they thought they were only going to get say to starts from him next year and could not trade him for much more than cents on the dollar',\n"," 'the coronavirus is infecting new yorkers of all stripes

programs in china were successful treating people with plasma is not a new thing it has been used in viruses in the past like for a hundred years the idea is that we take somebody who s fully recovered whose body has fought off the infection by making antibodies antibodies live in plasma in the blood explained dr ania wajnberg who s running the hospital s plasma donation program so presumably if we take the antibodies in the plasma from somebody who has recovered we can give them to somebody who s severely ill and try to kind of jumpstart their body to be able to fight off the infection the food and drug administration approved the treatment on an emergency basis and the hospital has tried the procedure on more than severely ill patients wajnberg said mount sinai wouldn t comment on how its patients are doing because it s too early to tell though one maryland hospital tweeted earlier this month that five patients who received plasma had improved the program would be impossible without covid survivors willing to donate they are having a potentially direct impact to help another sick person wajnberg said also they re helping us understand so much about the body s response to this disease and what potential treatment options and then further down the line how immunity can help us reopen our society and get people back to work so far more than survivors have answered mount sinai s calls for donations and around have been tested to see if they have the antibodies wajnberg and her team have identified over donors and that number is growing more and more everyday jeffrey yonkers a year old cpa from long island is one of those donors i am super excited yonkers told the post after he found out he was cleared for plasma donation at mount sinai i could cry the family man accountant heard about the program through media reports and felt compelled to help after beating the bug he went to mount sinai to have his blood tested and has now been cleared to donate plasma through the new york blood center he ll be screened and then hooked up to an iv for about an hour and a half so doctors can separate his red blood cells from the yellowish plasma fluid god forbid it was my wife that needed it or my family member yonkers who has an asthmatic son said by phone i always feel like i ve been fortunate in life so i try to give back jane grauer and her husband josh grauer were part of the original cluster of coronavirus cases that sprouted in westchester county after attending a service at the young israel of new rochelle synagogue she battled the virus for nearly three weeks and said the experience was like having the flu on steroids times infinity for her the hardest part came when she finally took a shower after weeks of baths i couldn t lift my arms to shampoo my hair and i started to cry that was like my lowest moment grauer a kindergarten teacher recalled and then i m like well shut up you know you re alive it s that attitude that compelled her to sign up for plasma donations after she finally tested negative for the virus on march i didn t die and i m so grateful to be alive and i m so grateful that my husband is alive it s incumbent on us to help other people who might literally have their lives saved grauer said she s been cleared to donate plasma through montefiore medical center and is in the process of setting up an appointment now shirley long island resident debra tavarone lost her brother in law to covid on march and contracted the bug while treating her mother and father in laws who d also caught the virus it literally took my breath away tavarone told the post i think i had every symptom there could have possibly been except for you know dying it was pretty bad when she heard about the plasma program she knew she had to sign up this is huge the mom of two said if i could save somebody that is on life support now even if i could save one person i d feel blessed she s working with mount sinai hospital now to get tested for the antibodies for julie thaler who was also part of the original cluster of westchester infections signing up to donate plasma wasn t even a question i truly believe that i am on my way to saving lives thaler told the post as she geared up to donate friday through columbia university after fighting the virus for nearly a month it s critical the light at the end of this tunnel of this long debilitating illness is that you can help to save lives and we possess antibodies that can do that thaler said this is such a huge unknown which is why people like me and other survivors need to help scientists answer these questions for viruses that have been fully studied developing antibodies typically means immunity but wajnberg said it s still not clear if that s the case with covid survivors it s also not clear how long the antibodies and immunity will remain in their system even though the u s and china haven t seen reinfections on a wide scale more research needs to be done to see the program s true impact and survivors still need to take precautions wajnberg said but as hundreds of people die everyday from the virus and doctors work around the clock to slow those numbers berrent believes the survivors and their willingness to help scientists find answers is the epicenter of hope and i think that that s really powerful said berrent who was

that every worker be screened for fever or respiratory symptoms at every shift but an ap report earlier this month found that infections were continuing to find their way into nursing homes because

one suspects online viewership will be sporadic concentration light but students shouldn t hover around their home mailboxes waiting for an envelope with a tuition rebate check and students and parents who expect campuses to reopen this fall next spring or the fall after that may be in for surprise and disappointment american higher education has been in serious and growing trouble in the past two decades yes our science and technology departments lead the world and the social sciences and humanities departments still boast some brilliant scholars but at some point too much of a good thing stops being a good thing people have observed for years that college graduates make more money over their lifetime than non college graduates but it doesn t follow that people not headed to college will make money if they go there a dismaying number of american college freshmen never end up graduating not after four or six or years an even more dismaying number of nongraduates and graduates end up with daunting amounts of college debt nondischargeable in bankruptcy which reduces or prevents significant wealth accumulation americans today have more college debt than credit card debt and for what in his new book the breakdown of higher education john ellis an emeritus professor at the university of california santa cruz cites multiple studies showing that half of graduates make no intellectual gains many schools don t teach the basics of us history or government college degrees aren t so much evidence of learning as of plodding persistence and a willingness to put up with left wing agitprop american universities keep grinding out more phds writing theses no one may ever read than they have tenure track teaching jobs so that an increasing number accept hourly wages as adjuncts and look forward to increases in the minimum wage meanwhile administrators now outnumber teachers at many institutions many spend their time in meetings and conferences promoting equity inclusivity and diversity some spend time enforcing speech codes prohibiting free expression that colleges and universities at one time fostered others are occupied in regulating adult students social behavior conducting kangaroo courts in which those accused of sexual harassment or assault are denied any presumption of innocence the ability to call witnesses and knowledge of any charges the notion that adults who are eligible to vote and serve in the military need such guidance is rooted in the latin phrase in loco parentis the notion that students at residential colleges need something like parental supervision even if that supervision is irksome and increasingly expensive the fact is that the residential college the model of american higher education since its th century foundations is the exception rather than the rule in most of the world university students typically live in parental homes or with roommates in cheap nearby apartments that s true of most undergraduates in britain where cambridge and oxford and their beautiful quads were the models for harvard and william mary for the or so selective colleges the residential college model will continue to be profitable but even harvard with its billion endowment saw fit to lay off hundreds of subcontracted campus dining hall workers dozens perhaps hundreds of lesser known schools whose graduates never get interviews with

they can somehow cut back on administrative bloat especially if the alternative is figuring out some other use for beautiful but suddenly obsolete campuses',\n"," 'with his announcement thursday that

normal but when and how when will that phased return begin if we have a month of the status quo with not even minimal adjustments or a more nuanced frame than essential nonessential it appears more

means to quarantine as either most new yorkers don t understand what it means or his own kid brother doesn t consistency matters this would have been a great moment for the governor to show that we re all in this together that no one gets special treatment and that his brother who has been open that he still has symptoms including fever shouldn t be leaving his room much less his house the gov

china that traffickers rely on for the chemicals to make such profitable drugs as methamphetamine and fentanyl one of the main suppliers that shut down is in wuhan the epicenter of the global outbreak associated press interviews with nearly two dozen law enforcement officials and trafficking experts found mexican and colombian cartels are still plying their trade as evidenced by recent drug seizures but the lockdowns that have turned cities into ghost towns are disrupting everything from production to transport to sales along the mile u s mexico border through which the vast majority of illegal drugs cross the normally bustling vehicle traffic that smugglers use for cover has slowed to a trickle bars nightclubs and motels across the country that are ordinarily fertile marketplaces for drug dealers have shuttered and prices for drugs in short supply have soared to gouging levels they are facing a supply problem and a demand problem said alejandro hope a security analyst and former official with cisen the mexican intelligence agency once you get them to the market who are you going to sell to virtually every illicit drug has been impacted with supply chain disruptions at both the wholesale and retail level traffickers are stockpiling narcotics and cash along the border and the u s drug enforcement administration even reports a decrease in money laundering and online drug sales on the so called dark web the godfathers of the cartels are scrambling said phil jordan a former director of the dea s el paso intelligence center cocaine prices are up percent or more in some cities heroin has become harder to find in denver and chicago while supplies of fentanyl are falling in houston and philadelphia in los angeles the price of methamphetamine has more than doubled in recent weeks to per pound you have shortages but also some greedy bastards who see an opportunity to make more money said jack riley the former deputy administrator of the dea the bad guys frequently use situations that affect the national conscience to raise prices synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine and fentanyl have been among the most affected in large part because they rely on precursor chemicals that mexican cartels import from china cook into drugs on an industrial scale and then ship to the u s this is something we would use as a lesson learned for us the head of the dea uttam dhillon told ap if the disruption is that significant we need to continue to work with our global partners to ensure that once we come out of the pandemic those precursor chemicals are not available to these drug trafficking organizations cartels are increasingly shifting away from drugs that require planting and growing seasons like heroin and marijuana in favor of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl which can be cooked throughout the year are up to times more powerful than heroin and produce a greater profit margin though some clandestine labs that make fentanyl from scratch have popped up sporadically in mexico cartels are still very much reliant upon chinese companies to get the precursor drugs huge amounts of these mail order components can be traced to a single state subsidized company in wuhan that shut down after the outbreak earlier this year said louise shelley director of the terrorism transnational crime and corruption center at george mason university which monitors chinese websites selling fentanyl the quarantine of wuhan and all the chaos there definitely affected the fentanyl trade particularly between china and mexico said ben westhoff author of fentanyl inc the main reason china has been the main supplier is the main reason china is the supplier of everything it does it so cheaply westhoff said there was really no cost incentive for the cartels to develop this themselves but costs have been rising and as in many legitimate industries the coronavirus is bringing about changes advertised prices across china for precursors of fentanyl methamphetamine and cutting agents have risen between and since late february said logan pauley an analyst at the center for advanced defense studies a washington based security research nonprofit so even as drug precursor plants in china are slowly reopening after the worst of the coronavirus crisis there some cartels have been taking steps to decrease their reliance on overseas suppliers by enlisting scientists to make their own precursor chemicals because of the coronavirus they re starting to do it in house added westhoff some chinese companies that once pushed precursors are now advertising drugs like hydroxychloroquine which president donald trump has promoted as potential treatment for covid as well as personal protective gear such as face masks and hand sanitizers meanwhile the gummed up situation on the u s mexico border resembles a stalled chess match where nobody especially the traffickers wants to make a wrong move said kyle williamson special agent in charge of the dea s el paso field division they re in a pause right now williamson said they don t want to get sloppy and take a lot of risks some mexican drug cartels are even holding back existing methamphetamine supplies to manipulate the market recognizing that no good crisis should be wasted said joseph brown the u s attorney in the eastern district of texas some cartels have given direct orders to members of their organization that anyone caught selling methamphetamine during this time will be killed said brown whose sprawling jurisdiction stretches from the suburbs of dallas to beaumont to be sure narcotics are still making their way into the u s as evidenced by a bust last month in which nearly million worth of street drugs were seized in a new smuggling tunnel connecting a warehouse in tijuana to southern san diego shelley said that bust was notable in that only about pounds of fentanyl was recovered much lower than usual shipments trump announced earlier this month that navy ships were being moved toward venezuela as part of a bid to beef up counter narcotics operations in the caribbean following a u s drug indictment against nicol s maduro but the pandemic also has limited law enforcement s effectiveness as departments cope with drug investigators working remotely falling ill and navigating a new landscape in which their own activities have become more

patients in mumbai india to study the gender disparity of the virus which has taken a worse toll on men according to a preliminary report posted on medrxix which hosts unpublished medical research papers that have not been peer reviewed dr aditi shastri an oncologist at montefiore medical center in the bronx and her mother dr jayanthi shastri a microbiologist at the kasturba hospital for infectious diseases in mumbai said the virus attaches itself to a protein that occurs in high levels in the testicles this protein known as angiotensin converting enzyme or ace is present in the lungs the gastrointestinal tract and the heart in addition to large quantities in the testicles but since testicles are walled off from the immune system the virus could harbor there for longer periods than the rest of the body according to the study the mother daughter researchers said these findings may explain why women bounce back from the virus more quickly than men they determined that the average amount of time for female patients to be cleared of the virus was four days while men saw recoveries that on average were two days longer the report said these observations demonstrate that male subjects have delayed viral clearance the authors wrote adding that the testicles may be serving as reservoirs for the virus the study may offer an explanation for reports out of italy south korea and new york city that men are dying at higher rates from the virus others have suggested that men are more vulnerable because they are more likely to smoke have high blood pressure or suffer coronary

entry for the hundreds of thousands of tourists coming to the us every month from china gotham has a uniquely high density of living that swells daily by millions from workers and tourists and manhattan sees some million commuters daily mostly on crowded public transit including from jersey alone yet the pandemic toll is falling dramatically so in new york including both hospitalizations and deaths per day few doubt that the unprecedented isolation policies had a significant impact on flattening the curves now we face another even greater problem how to sensibly re enter normal life this must be based on what we now know not on worst case projections using facts and fundamental medical knowledge not fear or single vision policies first we know the risk of dying from covid is far lower than initially thought and not significant for the overwhelming majority of those infected multiple recent studies from iceland germany usc stanford and new york city all suggest that the fatality rate if infected is likely far lower than early estimates perhaps under to percent i e to times lower than estimates that motivated extreme isolation in the big apple with almost one third of all us deaths the rate of death for all people ages to is percent or per in the population one eightieth of the rate for people age and over for people under the rate of death is zero per of empire

percent have been patients under years of age studying confirmed covid patients with symptoms bad enough to seek medical care dr leora horwitz of nyu medical center concluded age is far and away the strongest risk factor for hospitalization recent studies show a far more widespread rate of infection and lower rate of serious illness than early world health organization reports that noted percent of all cases were mild the vast majority of younger otherwise healthy people don t get hospitalized third due to fear and the single minded focus on covid regardless of cost other people are dying critical medical care isn t being provided millions of americans have missed critical health care for fear of encountering the disease and people are dying to make room for potential coronavirus patients when states and hospitals abruptly stopped nonessential procedures and surgery that didn t mean unimportant care treatments for the most serious illnesses including emergency care were missed some estimate about half of cancer patients deferred chemotherapy approximately percent of brain surgery cases were skipped perhaps half or more of acute stroke and heart attack patients missed their only chances for early treatment some dying and many now facing permanent disability transplants from living donors are down percent from the same period last year and that doesn t include the skipped cancer screenings avoided childhood vaccinations missed biopsies of now undiscovered cancers numbering thousands per week and countless other serious disorders left undiagnosed lastly total isolation prevents broad population immunity and prolongs the problem we know from decades of medical science that infection causes individuals to generate an immune response antibodies and the population later develops immunity indeed that is the main purpose of widespread immunization in other viral diseases to assist with herd immunity in the covid epicenter gotham higher immunity is likely although undoubtedly muted by the extreme isolation more than percent of those tested had antibodies while we don t know with certainty that antibodies from covid stop infection it would be expected based on decades of virology science including other coronavirus respiratory bugs where immunity post infection is thought to last for a year or more that s why scientists are hopeful about using covid antibodies to treat the sickest patients for population immunity it is great news that half of infected people are asymptomatic and that medical care isn t even necessary for the vast majority of people that fact has been incorrectly portrayed as an urgent problem requiring mass isolation on the contrary infected people are the immediately available vehicle for establishing widespread immunity by transmitting the virus to others in lower risk groups who then generate antibodies pathways toward the most vulnerable people are blocked ultimately eradicating the threat the curves have been flattened now we must use established medical science and the evidence we have gathered and for new york city in particular limit the enormous harms accumulating from broad isolation and economic lockdown while new york is unique strategy should now focus on rigorously protecting the most vulnerable and strictly regulate access to senior care centers officials must issue rational distancing guidelines to the elderly and their families including self isolating the mildly sick masks could be required for public transit we know children and young adults in good health have almost no risk of any serious illness from covid so logic means opening most schools with sensible precautions and sanitization standards most workplaces and businesses should reopen this would save lives prevent

that across the summer they made a true evaluation of a player and not just an identification of players that you are going to get to see them in the spring oppenheimer said i think a lot of our guys put in the core hard work to evaluate them as if they were going to be drafted sooner like so many work environments everywhere there are hurdles to clear that never existed it s not ideal players get

side dish for unemployed chefs it s often the only way for them to make money doing what they love at a time when sit down dining is prohibited by the state lockdown i was laid off six weeks ago it just wasn t possible to stay no matter how much the chef wanted to keep us i can t stand not working i miss being in the kitchen said ian tenzer a year old former sous chef at three star michelin restaurant eleven madison park named the world s best restaurant in working as a private chef has always been a part of the industry i had thought about working in and at this point in my career it s a good choice economically and professionally he added indeed chefs who choose to work in private homes stand to get a percent to percent pay raise as well as other perks including better hours

staff the vast majority of restaurant chefs are grossly underpaid and seldom receive benefits and now clients are being very generous and accommodating youdovin said one drawback is that you never know what kind of family you ll get chefs said some families are lovely adventurous and curious but others can be quite the opposite they can be rude and even physically and verbally abusive i have heard horror stories said one chef who asked to remain unnamed money can be a very corrupting influence working in a restaurant by contrast gives rising chefs an opportunity to learn from the best and there s often a strong sense of camaraderie that can t be replicated in a private home when you work in a restaurant you are part of a team there are peers you look up to and others you teach the team becomes your family and you learn to love everyone that s the hardest part about leaving the restaurant job tenzer explained the pandemic also has made the interviewing process more challenging normally people vying for a private chef position will cook up tastings for families in their own kitchens but now chefs are preparing tastings in their own homes and then dropping them off at their prospective employer s front door this social distancing measure along with virtual interviews by zoom or facetime are making it tough for both the chefs and families to determine if they are making a good match youdovin said part of being a private chef is being able to interact with the family the kids their guests it s about having the right charisma for the family some are more formal than others it s about chemistry as well as tastings youdovin added for some chefs the new gigs are short term until the pandemic subsides brokers dolly and jenny lenz who deal in high end real estate say

facilities run by tyson foods and smithfield foods sources said on april president trump signed an executive order shielding plants from forced closures by state governors but facilities owned by big

stratis morfogen founder of philippe chow and co founder of the brooklyn chop house was gearing up to open his new concept brooklyn dumpling shop in the east village just before covid hit the square foot space at st marks place and first avenue a operation featuring kinds of dumplings including peanut butter and jam matzo ball soup and wonton with vanilla ice cream was originally planning to offer a shake shack style pickup counter and limited seating two weeks into lockdown however morfogen changed almost everything the shop now slated to open in july vows zero human interaction instead of a server behind a counter patrons will be greeted by an foot high wall of lockers which will contain orders of steaming hot dumplings when restaurants reopen nobody is going to be saying do you feel like chinese or italian tonight morfogen told side dish it will be where do you feel safest restaurants planning summer openings and reopenings are introducing disposable masks and menus taking customers temperatures and pressing the city for more leeway to serve diners outdoors but in the case of brooklyn dumpling shop hungry guests will get a high tech experience that s pointedly lacking when it comes to the human touch the front of the shop will be staffed by a single greeter wearing a face covering and gloves of course who will beckon customers through a device that s able to scan body temperatures if a patron draws a red light instead of a green one it could mean they have a fever or perhaps that they were holding a cup of hot coffee for a final verdict the greeter leads the customer to a wall unit that takes wrist temperatures if the second reading lands in the red zone sorry no dumplings according to morfogen only two customers will be allowed into the shop at a time versus a planned capacity of for the earlier design once inside customers who haven t already ordered from their phones can visit one of two wiped down self ordering kiosks the kiosks are equipped with heat sensing screens that can detect fingers and credit cards hovering above them and which don t need to be touched once finished waving their fingers and credit card over them customers finally come face to face with the wall of lockers the locker goes from red when your order is in to yellow which means two minutes out to green when you scan your phone on a keypad the locker opens and you take your food and go morfogen says cooks place the order in the individual lockers further limiting contact between kitchen and customer the lockers also are heated and hygienically disinfected morfogen notes what s more it s very cost effective you save three people every hours of labor brooklyn dumpling shop may be better suited to this setup than most restaurants even before the virus the plan was to showcase a hulking stainless steel machine in the front window that s capable of cranking out dumplings an hour we call it the dumpling lab morfogen says with a plan for the machine to supply future locations in addition to the east village flagship i hope we need it the automated locker system developed by chicago based apex supply chain technologies is a long way from vending machines and costs around depending on software options chief executive mike wills says scan and go technology which was first used in airports and water parks will gain traction with restaurants post

way of course we ve all spent these past couple of months going against so much that we ve learned and without a coronavirus vaccine available it s either this sanitized version of the national

blessing this endeavor we ll take what we can get much like we would treat an game season as legitimate because of the circumstances that compelled it it would be silly to scoff at baseball compromised by regulations to keep anyone from getting sick or dying really the only scoffing to be done would be to question whether baseball should be putting itself out there at all given the legitimate potential of something going horribly awry we can hold that debate another day though if they re going to give this a shot they can t do so cavalierly and the weirdness not even out of town

a chef choose the meal known as omakase when the pandemic forced gotham restaurants to close their dine in operations in mid march kissaki wasn t exactly the go to option for takeout that started to

they re not even available through distributors because of covid we used to pay for a pack of pieces and now we pay around he says adding he also saves on hokkaido uni trays what s more the new sushi

heavy kitchen appliance than something out of star wars are used to roll nigiri rice balls delicately without crushing the rice grains kanfer says he s also invested in maki making machines that produce sheets of rice of various thickness at a pace of up to sheets per hour the equipment sales came with a coronavirus discount of percent to percent or around each kissaki s second location is based inside greek restaurant nerai which has resorted to a profit sharing model during covid to make use of its three story space all the restaurants contribute to rent the next move kanfer said is

and it was done safely and successfully for one week at least the mission was accomplished it was the first mainstream american professional sporting event that has been staged since the pandemic put a pause to every sport back in march and other than the lack of spectators per day and a few good parties in the corporate tents around the grounds the charles schwab challenge and colonial country club could not have delivered any better this week make no mistake this event was a guinea pig a test balloon not just for golf but for every professional league preparing to restart its season as we all try to move forward in search of whatever the new normalcy will be the success this week began with all players and their caddies testing negative for covid and it ended with a compelling final round shootout with daniel berger winning in a playoff and slipping on the signature tartan blazer that comes with victory at colonial at the end of the day though with all kudos going to berger the most important end game to the week was not who won but the fact this event safely arrived to the finish line and now the tour may move on with confidence to this week s rbc heritage championship at hilton head s c i think it s gone about as well as we could have hoped for pga tour commissioner jay monahan said sunday there s more work to be done this is about a sustained return but i think as we sit here late in the day on sunday there s no question that this has been an exceptional week monahan was asked if the overriding emotion from the week is relief or excitement and he said i think it s a sense of excitement but you can t have one without the other i guess in this environment what kept him up at night leading into this historic restart i think the biggest concern given the amount of time that we put into our testing and safety protocols was that even though we felt really good about the plan we had in place if we saw the number of tests that were positive or we got into a situation where we were dealing with a number of positive tests that s something candidly that i lost a lot of sleep over in the weeks that preceded coming in there monahan said a lot of challenges but i would say that would probably have been the biggest concern because it s the one that we ve all been dealing with wrestling with trying to understand and trying to prepare for it was an historic weird and sometimes moving week i would say it s hard to pick a favorite moment because there s so many along the way monahan said i think just everybody being back together and being on property on

hesitations about asking for anything right now because there are a lot of other people who would take my job for less money forget that myth the loss of human capital and knowledge cannot be fixed by replacing existing staff possessing existing intellectual capital and relationships internally and externally with new staff says mcmahon the costs of hiring training and integrating new people into the workforce especially when working from home is far more complicated than keeping the great staff that are already in place to that end you may find it beneficial to take inventory of all that you bring to the table right now so you have the facts handy for a talk with your boss taking on new roles and responsibilities in wake of the covid crisis jot it down spearheading your company s crisis communications add it to the list make sure that you are objectively taking note of all of these things and sharing that with your manager says fotini iconomopoulos negotiation consultant and author of the upcoming book say less get more harpercollins for example if you re speaking to more clients per day churning out more business than usual picking up the slack for being short staffed and more bring that up iconomopoulos recommends framing the chat around the idea that you ve been contributing more and would like to make sure you are compensated for stepping up be confident and consider things from your employer s perspective they re benefiting from all that you do and losing you right now would be a particularly trying blow with many new hire searches on freeze or considering the

says jill tipograph co founder of early stage careers phrase it as if i temporarily take over customer service for the next three months could you increase my pay by percent or whatever is reasonable she says to gauge if your ask seems sensible ask three friends from diverse backgrounds to assess if your request is fair but be warned that once your salary request is presented you cannot take it back says tipograph ask for a one time bonus some companies have initiated salary freezes right now and a raise may be out of the question for these cases ask your employer if you can receive a performance based bonus once the company rebounds says lynda spiegel job search coach and founder of rising star resume who concedes that many employers may be reluctant to commit to this right now nevertheless substantiate your accomplishments as you would pre pandemic when negotiating for a raise if you re successful a good strategy would be to graciously accept a commitment to defer the salary increase until the crisis abates says spiegel already owed a raise try this if you were due for a raise as the virus issue emerged it would be good to memorialize any all discussions that occur save e mails send yourself notes of verbal discussions and dates because when the time comes to get things back on track the person s you had this discussion with may no longer be with the firm says tipograph remember salary enhancements are earned and not doled out so continue to put in the grunt work if you expect to be recognized early careerists especially should use this time to go above and beyond at work they have been hit among the hardest as a generation during this time says tipograph ask for the fun stuff if a raise or bonus won t get the green light there s still plenty of room to obtain work life improvements from your company right now whether it s additional vacation days a permanent or part time work from home setup or another benefit first get the obvious things approved if you re working from home you could ask your employer to pay for items like wi fi phone additional computer monitors office chairs microphones webcams and other essentials you can make the case for the items related to your work as they directly relate to productivity and professionalism says benjamin ritter leadership and empowerment coach and founder of live for yourself consulting as

of the new york dea told the post while the country s primary focus should be the pandemic the shadow of the pandemic is the drug business he added the coronavirus led to an uptick in cash

organized crime syndicate before the pandemic hit the cartels distributed fentanyl laced heroin to the street level dominican dealers who in turn kicked up cash profits to the chinese gangsters the chinese criminals would then use the money to buy goods in the us cellphones computers cars and flip them in china for a profit before paying back the cartel traffickers a phone bought in the us for could sell in china for as much as special agent donovan said when stores in new york shut as the city went on lockdown the gangsters couldn t go shopping for the goods leaving them with an excess amount of cash and opportunity for the feds to seize it the shopping scheme doesn t work with online purchases because authorities can more easily trace who is buying the goods the store closings have stalled their distribution methodology they can t spend the cash and that is why we are confiscating record amounts donovan added in addition the limited number of flights in and out of the us plus stricter border and highway enforcement has blocked the same flow of drugs from entering the country and the cash from leaving the effort to block drug trafficking is critical right now because

wealthier neighborhoods in brooklyn and manhattan including the financial district and greenwich village according to lab reports we didn t see an uptick from the protests they reached their peak over a month ago at this point cohen said when asked why the tracing corps wasn t tracking protest attendance earlier in the week dr jay varma mayor bill de blasio s senior adviser for public health said

some reasonable steps trying to ascertain this information could compromise our ability to establish the trust that we need kachur explained but a former associate commissioner for the federal food

our fair city s covid infection rates among the age group and we aren t asking if they ve attended a black lives matter protest that s called hypocrisy too wake up your honor closing your eyes and covering your ears won t change the facts pitts said dr jake deutsch co founder of cure urgent care that s tested over patients for covid agreed that the tracing corps should ask about protests the purpose of contact tracing is you re trying to identify sources of where the infections are occurring so i think you ask about gatherings whether it s bars protests schools churches the question shouldn t just stop with were you in a restaurant you d have to be much inclusive and trying to predict that bars are the source of the problem i think that s a pretty impossible presumption given the fact that it s a highly contagious virus deutsch said he believes the higher proportion of twenty somethings testing positive for covid is due to increased testing for all new yorkers not just the elderly and vulnerable i ve seen more young people be tested than we d seen for months ago for instance so i think you re going to see a spike when you see more testing deutsch said',\n"," 'with nfl

football than it is in any other sport of course the nfl does have protocol safeguards in place it would be malpractice if the league did not and the league knows it better than anyone but the players

standard general twin river based in lincoln ri now owns gambling properties across six states as well as a horse racetrack with authorized off track betting licenses in colorado it acquired three of those properties in april as casino giants caesars entertainment and eldorado resorts scrambled to sell assets to close on a planned billion merger in addition to buying bally s a room hotel and casino on the atlantic city boardwalk from caesars twin river also scooped up eldorado s namesake property in shreveport la and its montbleu in lake tahoe nev for million twin river paid just times earnings for the three venues or roughly the cost of the real estate kim says the price we offered was really low he said even if these casinos are closed for two years it s a good deal while caesars and eldorado sold to win regulatory approval for their merger the coronavirus also played a role experts said noting that the shreveport property was on track to fetch as much as million in january before the deal fell through kim made headlines in for partnering with american apparel s controversial founder and ceo charney after charney had been ousted for alleged sexual harassment efforts to

with its twin river stake in it was generating million in annual earnings that s now projected to grow to million as twin river s chairman kim is aiming for earnings of million a year he said with the exception of bally s all of twin river s casinos are in the green since reopening in may kim said it s amazing how behavior bounces back kim said i think spending has been a little better at the casinos than for discretionary purchases people enjoy gambling',\n"," 'at the height of new york s coronavirus lockdown domestic violence in the five boroughs skyrocketed data show when the pandemic first laid siege experts predicted that mandatory lockdowns and soaring unemployment would cause a rise in household abuse and figures now bear them out with domestic violence reports at some agencies doubling and even tripling in the past few months we ve never been busier lamented nechama bakst senior director of the met council s family violence program we have seen people who never experienced violence starting to experience violence and people who have experienced violence experience worse violence typically the non profit gets about new cases a month but in april they juggled another in may and more in june the organization said we see more choking more sexual violence kind of much more intense and serious acts of crime the director said at sanctuary for families which also works with survivors there was a similar increase in calls to its helpline in may the group received calls compared to for the month the year before in june calls more than tripled with compared to last year domestic violence is fundamentally about power and control said dorchen leidholdt director of sff s legal center the coronavirus pandemic gave abusers a powerful tool of control because their victims were in much closer proximity to them in many cases and had less access to sources of support and assistance in many cases the pandemic became just one more tool in a perpetrator s arsenal experts said some abusers would withhold personal protective equipment from their victims so it wouldn t be safe to leave home in other cases if an abuser ended up catching the coronavirus they would shame and blame their partner for it or become physically violent advocates said some would also refuse to social distance or wash their hands and then taunt their victims about it in a way that made them feel unsafe bakst said one abuser warned a victim you better watch your back because the courts are closed so you can t do anything said sff which helped the person in need get an order of protection high unemployment brought on by the virus only compounded the situation because abusers are more physically violent and likely to kill when they re out of work experts said it was a twin tsunami leidholdt said on the one hand abusers were unemployed angry and more abusive than ever with more access to their victims than ever and then victims were more economically dependent than ever before amid the lockdowns the abused were trapped inside with their perpetrators all day forcing some to hide in their bathrooms in the dead of night so they could whisper frantic pleas for help into their phones as their abusers slept said david greenfield the met council s ceo in response both the sff and met council created a text based helpline for victims which was a much safer way to communicate the experts noted that the most dangerous moment for a victim is when they re trying to leave their abuser which is why most escapes are carried out when the attackers are out of the house with coronavirus stay at home orders in place fleeing became more difficult and thus more dangerous making situations that are already bad exponentially worse greenfield told the post in one case a woman and her children were in a highly highly dangerous situation with an abuser who kept weapons in the home bakst said the torment against the victims escalated amid the pandemic and the woman asked the met council for help getting her and her kids out we figured out a time of day it was literally minutes that she had where she was not being watched bakst recalled and in those minutes we coordinated a way to get her to a place where she can get out and get to safety still for many victims reaching out is never easy and became even harder amid the pandemic advocates said there was one woman who said she was too scared to call because she was concerned police officers would give her coronavirus bakst said seeking help outside the home was more difficult than ever because the courts were operating virtually there was a period when the nypd was dealing with its own coronavirus crisis and we did not see the same level of responsiveness when a survivor called leidholdt added the only way to get help is the telephone and using a telephone when you re in close quarters with an abuser is nearly impossible when victims did get a chance to call for help they used codes devised with their case worker to discreetly communicate whether the offender was around if someone starts giving us directions to the mall that was code for like i gotta go without saying i gotta go he s here bakst explained for some people it s i got to put dinner in the oven and that means to the social worker fyi he s here for abusers used to targeting vulnerable people a global pandemic perfectly set the stage for increased exploitation leidholdt said abusers tend to be serial perpetrators they seek out vulnerable victims and take advantage of victim s vulnerability and the coronavirus pandemic significantly increased the vulnerability of women and children in particular in new york city she said it increased their vulnerability economically it increased their vulnerability in terms of public health it increased their vulnerability in what is a really very terrifying environment where venturing out unprotected can lead to illness and even death the advocate went on abusers take advantage of those kinds of situations they use them and they exploit them to increase their power and control over victims at times leidholdt and her team found themselves fairly overwhelmed by the need of domestic violence survivors amid the pandemic she said even though we had the help of eight large law firms we got more calls and clients in need of assistance than in key moments we were able to assist leidholdt recalled ultimately no one was turned away but the nonprofit gets many more referrals than they have the capacity to assist shining a light on the need for increased services for domestic violence victims staff said the coronavirus pandemic has plunged the big apple billions of dollars into the red and many programs for domestic violence survivors have been cut in the fy budget fiscal reports show the cuts include programs that support survivors post victimization and funding for various district attorney s offices that allow for improved prosecution even as crimes related to domestic violence such as murder rape and assault have increased reports show funding for domestic violence programs under the human resources administration was cut by nearly million the biggest decrease it has faced in years reports show while leidholdt said the cuts could ve been a lot worse funding wasn t enough even before the pandemic certainly this isn t new but we see it more during the time of the coronavirus pandemic there is a much greater need for legal services for clinical services for economic empowerment services and for shelter services than currently exists for all of these services there are wait lists leidholdt said the sad reality is they are not remotely adequate additional reporting by nolan hicks',\n"," 'mlb could not make it out of the first weekend

flying back to miami after the game until monday when they are scheduled to play their home opener against the orioles the results will determine if other members of the marlins traveling party have to stay quarantined in philadelphia marlins catcher jorge alfaro already was placed on the injured list friday before the miami philadelphia series began without a public reason given players must

available earlier this month miami placed outfielders lewis brinson and matt joyce on the il without further explanation after mlb and the marlins learned of the positive tests tracing was done to determine who those players had been in contact with and the other players were questioned about symptoms and it was decided to play sunday s game miguel rojas one of the marlins team leaders said all marlins met and there was never a thought that we would not play marlins manager don mattingly said we never considered not playing sunday we are taking risks every day the concern remains that players can be asymptomatic spreaders before tests reveal the virus plus the potential contagion is not limited to just one team the phillies incurred greater risk sunday too and the risk grows of infecting family it s fair to say that guys are concerned mattingly said we are talking about health we are talking about these guys traveling back to their families and kids and we want to be safe they have a voice and we are going to listen to try to weather lost players mlb and the players association agreed to allow teams to have a player pool from which to choose during the season with the non active players working out at a satellite site and teams on the road taking a three man taxi squad that must include a catcher mattingly mentioned that mlb should consider expanding the taxi squad so that teams in a scramble have more options at their disposal but what is the critical mass of absences that would move mlb to cancel a game or more the sport is used to dealing with player loss since the season began thursday star pitchers ken giles clayton kershaw corey kluber stephen strasburg and justin verlander were all reported injured perhaps that is normal perhaps it is a result of a second but abbreviated training camp to ready for the shortened season but pitching injuries in particular are familiar what the marlins are enduring is unfamiliar the same for the reds who had matt davidson show a positive test on saturday then on sunday without explanation placed mike moustakas on the injured list and scratched nick senzel from the lineup it is not revealed whether players tested positive or just showed symptoms and caution was being used mlb s testing numbers have been promisingly low to date but none has been released publicly since teams started traveling for regular season games which entails among other things flights and hotels it also means a team from a current covid epicenter such as miami will travel to other cities and host games in its city with virus numbers in south florida soaring a major reason canada refused to allow the blue jays to play their home games in toronto was because of concerns about teams from hot spots traveling into the country

couple weeks just because you don t know how my wife s going to react how the boys are going to react to it brach said saturday afternoon on a zoom call so it was a nerve wracking time her biggest thing was that she wanted me to be there and we were hearing different things from the doctor that if i m still testing positive i can t come or even if it was past days i couldn t be there for the birth so that was kind of the emotional roller coaster i was on more so than the baseball stuff because i knew that was going to be at least two or three weeks away brach was ultimately allowed to be

extremely competitive right out of the gate the summit series between canada and the ussr began on sept the world cup of hockey ended with game of the finals on sept thus there is an abundance of high quality summer hockey that serves as evidence of what motivated players can do even if beginning with a standing start the league is going to attempt to tailor the rinks with each team s unique hometown flavor in toronto and edmonton whether potvin sucks following the whistle that ignites the four decades old chant will be part of the package for game rangers vs candy canes is as yet unknown there is that word again it is all ahead of us it is all ahead of the nhl we have spent a lifetime familiarizing ourselves with the defensive zone the neutral zone and the offensive zone and about red

which your opponent doesn t have its starting quarterback or point guard luck of the draw if you are playing too many day games after night games or your west coast trips are particularly ill timed your executives probably lobbied to change it before it became official but here you are this major league season though has put all these concepts through the looking glass which players are available daily has never been more in question since a common cold now will put a player on the injured list until he tests a few times to demonstrate it is not covid which opponent you are playing and where has become a multiple choice question no team is going to be immune from the implications flexibility is going to mean a lot more than if a player can kick his leg up above his head but clearly greater advantages and disadvantages will be derived the blue jays for example have no home games in their actual toronto home the marlins when they are scheduled to restart tuesday will have had to alter more than half a roster decimated by covid the phillies did not play in the last week due to proximity to the infested marlins which could mean as many as games in days if they are to complete a game schedule conversely the yankees to date have benefited more than most again no club is immune dj lemahieu missed most of spring training with the virus and luis cessa and aroldis chapman are just returning now does tommy kahnle need tommy john surgery because of the build up shut down build up reality of a re start that has seen a spree of pitching injuries the yankees last week were stuck two days in philadelphia without playing were about to return home perhaps to play the phillies and then pivoted to baltimore to play the orioles but even in that last one you see the glimmer there is no such thing as a sure win in the majors but putting the yankees in camden yards is as close as you get what else aided and abetted the yankees in a start juan soto learned just hours before the season opener that he was covid positive so the defending champs lost the best hitter from a lineup that already was without anthony rendon signed with the angels and ryan zimmerman opted out of the season the nationals won once against the yankees the middle game of the three game set in which stephen strasburg was scratched with nerve pain in his right hand which emphasizes that not every gift is opened if your season is going to be impacted by covid there is a blessing to being in the right place at the right time the yankees had two games in philadelphia postponed but rather than have to go on an extended hiatus and risk losing the edge of playing they were able to go to baltimore to play because the orioles were supposed to be facing the marlins thus the marlins and phillies were shut down but the yankees were able to keep on playing comparatively as an example the nationals will have four days off before playing tuesday because over the weekend they were supposed to play the marlins the red sox have just one quality starter and the yankees missed nathan eovaldi because he pitched wednesday against the mets in addition eduardo rodriguez will not pitch this season due to a heart issue the red sox believe is a ramification of the lefty having had covid the only two red sox pitchers with sustained success against the yankees last year were eovaldi and rodriguez the phillies will have gone seven days without playing when they face the yankees in the bronx on monday they were put on ice to await to see if any of their personnel contracted coronavirus after playing three games against the marlins no phillie player tested positive the team has had three workouts it is human nature to think why us or poor phillies why did this happen jake arrieta told philadelphia reporters sunday but once you have that initial thought and get it out of your head and turn the page then it is time to think what do we have to do to stay ready as ready as we possibly can even though it is difficult nevertheless a good attitude isn t as valuable as continuing to face strong competition arrieta said with simulated games and bullpen sessions he is good for at least pitches in his monday debut but expect phillies manager joe girardi to be cautious in how much he extends any of his arms in the short run considering the rampant pitching injuries consuming the game that should be another advantage yankees in this bizarre season',\n"," 'wealthy new yorkers who fled the city during the coronavirus crisis don t want to come back and may be further deterred

unable to agree on a fourth aid package the white house last week dispatched meadows and treasury secretary steven mnuchin to negotiate with democrats as the per week boost to unemployment benefits was set to expire but the negotiations have proved fruitless and jobless benefits ended at midnight on friday with no deal in sight affecting tens of millions of americans who have lost their jobs

the way of that the speaker also pushed back on meadows claim that he had made several offers accusing republicans of being in disarray while democrats are in total agreement over the need for a per week boost to state unemployment the idea that they made a proposal is really not actually factual she said appearing on this week immediately after pelosi mnuchin said he believed the jobless payments led to many americans being overpaid and argued it discouraged them from returning to the workforce unemployment is supposed to be a wage replacement so it should be tied to some percentage of wages he said saying that the only reason why americans received a flat rate is because of year old computer systems i think on the concept we absolutely agree on enhanced unemployment we want to fix the issue where in some cases people are overpaid there s no question that in some cases where we re paying people more to stay home than to work that s created issues in the entire economy he said at a press conference in manhattan on sunday schumer accused senate majority leader mitch mcconnell of dithering on negotiations and failing to engage with a rival trillion bill the house passed in may while it is a positive step that the white house is finally willing to make progress on these negotiations significant divisions remain he said calling for eviction protections and additional money for struggling state authorities months of delay and dithering by leader mcconnell has made all of this a lot harder but when it comes to ensuring new york and the country have the funding

in spain and the netherlands have scientists digging into how the animals got infected and if they can spread it to people in the meantime authorities have killed more than million minks at breeding farms in both countries as a precaution the virus that first infected people in china late last year came from an animal source probably bats and later spread from person to person as other coronaviruses had done in the past some animals including cats tigers and dogs have picked up the new coronavirus from people but there hasn t been a documented case of animals spreading it back to humans the outbreaks among the minks on farms in the netherlands and spain likely started with infected workers although officials aren t certain but it also is plausible that some workers later caught the virus back from the minks the dutch government and a researcher said and scientists are exploring whether that was the case and how much of a threat such a spread might be the outbreak at the spanish mink farm near la puebla de valverde a village of people was discovered after seven of the employees including the owner tested positive in late may said joaqu n olona regional chief of agriculture and environment two other employees got infected even after the operation was shut down more than minks were ordered killed at the farm in the aragon region of northeastern spain with nine out of animals estimated to have contracted the virus after the dutch outbreaks began in april professor wim van der poel a veterinarian who studies viruses at wageningen university and research determined that the virus strain in the animals was similar to the one circulating among humans we assumed it was possible that it would be transmitted back to people again the virus expert said and that s what appeared to have happened with at least two of the infected workers richard ostfeld a researcher at the cary institute of ecosystem studies in millbrook new york said that if confirmed these would be the first known instances of animal to human transmission with the evidence for farmed mink to human transmission we definitely need to be concerned with the potential for domesticated animals that are infected to pass on their infection to us ostfeld said by email the u s centers for disease control and prevention says some coronaviruses that infect animals can be spread to humans and then spread between people but it adds that this is rare both the world health organization and the paris based world organisation for animal health are studying the transmission of the virus between animals and people several universities and research institutes also are examining the issue the who has noted that the transmission on the mink breeding farms could have happened both ways but who s dr maria van kerkhove said at a news conference last month that such transmission was very limited this gives us some clues about which animals may be susceptible to infection and this will help us as we learn more about the potential animal reservoir of the virus she said referring to cases in the netherlands and denmark another major producer of mink fur while scientists think the virus originated in bats it may have passed through another animal before infecting people a who team is currently in china planning to study the issue more than million minks have been killed on dutch farms that recorded outbreaks according to the netherlands food and consumer product safety authority the government announced thursday that minks at a th farm also were infected and would be killed the netherlands which has some mink farms is the world s fourth biggest producer of the prized fur after denmark china and poland according to wim verhagen director of the dutch federation of fur farmers spain has active mink breeding operations most of them in northwestern galicia both spain and the netherlands have tightened hygiene protocols at mink farms and banned transportation of

pandemic staffers at new york s largest hospital network were forced to shop at hardware stores for garden hoses to make the ventilators they had received from the state actually work according to a new book this experience and many others resulted in northwell health seeking to buy its own medical supply company so it never again has to rely on china or other governments for vital goods like vents scrubs and masks we should never again have less than a robust stockpile of ventilators and other essential equipment overreliance on china to manufacture vital supplies is a perilous gamble northwell health executive director michael dowling writes in leading through a pandemic we at northwell health are considering acquiring a supply company to achieve a measure of self sufficiency when it comes to vital supplies the newly published page book co written by dowling and northwell s chief journalist editor charles kenney is believed to be the first major book written by front line medical providers who confronted the killer bug s devastating impact on new york costing lives northwell s network of hospitals treated some coronavirus patients more than anywhere in the country but staffers were plagued by a dire lack of medical equipment so much so that even when we did receive much needed ventilators from new york state many arrived without parts needed to make them functional execs wrote at one point our staff members went to hardware stores to purchase garden hoses which they cut up and attached so vents would work northwell s employees also used d printed parts to help fashion makeshift breathing machines and nasal swabs to test patients for covid the book says the over reliance on foreign companies extended to pharmaceutical drugs northwell officials said suggesting this was a serious national security issue the united states army didn t outsource its bullet making to china said dr kevin tracey ceo of northwell s feinstein institute for medical research the hospital network s strategy to control its future regarding personal protective equipment is just one takeaway from the book which explores the lessons it learned during the height of the virus outbreak northwell officials said they have been exploring the possibility since may and that there have been ongoing discussions with private manufacturers we re in talks with a couple of companies you can t depend on people overseas for supplies when you are in the middle of a war dowling told the post on sunday the tome makes recommendations on how to better prepare for a future disaster one being that the government should abolish or revise existing rules so medical staffers have more flexibility to respond to public health crises fortunately northwell officials said gov andrew cuomo and federal health officials had this time waived many of regulations and laws which exempted doctors and hospitals from medical malpractice suits and making it easier to convert space into covid treatment units other proposals include protecting the physical and emotional needs of staff expanding partnerships with other hospital systems across the country and accelerating the movement for tele health care the book treads lightly on the controversy surrounding the covid deaths in new york nursing homes northwell officials generally call for better safety measures in congregate settings such as nursing homes there was too much death in these facilities and we have work to prepare safer congregate environments going forward they wrote the book also describes how the virus depleted staff at one point workers were quarantined for being infected or exposed to the virus including more than percent at hard hit forest hills and valley stream hospitals northwell said it hired thousands of visiting healthcare professionals and redeployed staffers which included mandatory reassignment when the worst of the pandemic hit the virus also took a financial toll costing northwell billion in lost revenue and added costs but the provider said it paid bonuses to front line workers for their heroic work and said it would worry about the financial reckoning later in addition to planning for a future pandemic the book delves into tales of heroism and hearthbreak from the front lines at lenox hill hospital for example one nurse played the us navy band s version of the star spangled banner on her iphone for relatives of a veteran saying their final goodbyes not everyone was lucky enough to have their family nearby when the moment came a worker at staten island university hospital describes in the book how he chose to stay at work instead of making his three hour trek home to yonkers just to make sure a patient wouldn t die alone it s always going to be with me john baez wrote the sadness that she couldn t have a loved one with her but i couldn t let her die alone the book describes how long island jewish forest hills was so overwhelmed by the pandemic that covid patients were transferred to its other hospitals during a four week period and people died at the queens hospital on a single day in march staff members were shell shocked the book states in one wrenching episode a woman with the virus gave birth at lij forest hills and then died her husband succumbed to the virus as well orphaning their newborn in normal times that would have been such a tragic story that our teams would have been talking about it and little else for a month the book states but in the crisis it was just another story those on the front lines of the crisis will likely be reckoning with the impact of their experiences and of the many heartbreaking losses for a long time to come',\n"," 'the athletics and astros engaged in a bench clearing brawl sunday

according to a new study researchers at duke university made the discovery while testing different types of masks according to the study published friday n masks often used by health care professionals worked best to stop the transmission of respiratory droplets during regular speech other good performers at stopping leakage were three layer surgical masks and cotton masks which can be made at home the researchers with duke s physics department found but while bandannas and knitted face coverings may be a unique look they did not offer much protection according to the study the scientists also discovered that neck fleeces or neck gaiters often worn by runners were the least effective and actually allowed more respiratory droplets to escape than not wearing a mask at all that s because they were shown to break down larger droplets into smaller particles allowing them to slip out the sides of the covering more easily we were extremely surprised to find that the number of particles measured with the fleece actually exceeded the number of particles measured without wearing any mask martin fischer one of the study s authors told cnn we want to emphasize that we really encourage people to wear masks but we want them to wear masks that actually work to test the masks the scientists made use of a black box outfitted with a laser and a cellphone camera someone wearing a face mask would speak in the direction of the laser beam inside the box then the amount of respiratory droplets scattered by the beam were recorded by the camera in the back of the box a computer algorithm counted the droplets seen in the video to determine how many had leaked through the researchers said this was a low cost effective method to test which face coverings worked and which didn t this is a very powerful visual tool to raise awareness that very simple masks like these homemade cotton masks do really well to stop the majority of these respiratory droplets fischer told cnn companies and manufacturers can set this up and test their mask designs before producing them which would also be very useful',\n"," 'gov andrew cuomo on sunday demanded the nypd do more to enforce

and medicare premiums like virtually everyone paying their salaries could save roughly million a year the independent budget office has estimated but municipal unions don t have a track record of simply volunteering givebacks even to save jobs history suggests they will fight tooth and nail to protect everything they have even in a fiscal crisis to win real concessions the mayor needs leverage and he can get it from the state financial control board fcb created in the mid s to deal with the city fiscal crisis and still in existence as a background watchdog the city should adopt a more justifiably pessimistic revenue forecast and declare to the fcb that its budget gaps can t be fully closed without deficit bond financing the board then will have grounds for asking the legislature to reinstate a control period and authorize an across the board wage freeze as the late former mayor ed koch recognized the fcb can be a mayor s best friend by ordering bigger budget cuts than politicians have the nerve to suggest in public that might just might lead to serious labor bargaining over more palatable alternatives this scenario would require a strong partnership between the

suggesting the building of more housing but there has never been a better opportunity to increase the number of affordable homes in the city than now before covid we had a housing affordability crisis because of plus years of government regulation that made it unprofitable to build affordable apartments over time the situation got worse as property taxes rose dramatically leading to even higher rents now is the time to flip the switch we need to ease some of the oppressive regulations on developing new apartment buildings and fixing up vacant rent stabilized units provide property tax relief for buildings that can be passed on to renters encourage development near transit hubs such as outlined in the yimby act a bipartisan bill now before congress and that chip supports if we don t build more housing the existing stock will become continuously obsolete luxury apartments will continue to sit empty low income renters will continue to fight to live in overcrowded settings the city s

tensions yet until biden s recent press outing and visit to kenosha wis his handlers seem to have assumed that if he were to leave his basement and fully enter the fray he could be capable of losing the election in moments of gaffes lapses or prolonged silences so wisely team biden relied on the fact that the commander in chief is always blamed for bad news and there has been plenty of bad news worldwide this year that reality was reflected in the spring and early summer polls that showed growing discontent with the incumbent president trump as if he were solely responsible for one of the most depressing years in us history but news cycles like polls are not always static what was true in july is not necessarily so in september and especially in november volatile years produce volatile voters now many voters think they see a waning of the virus a need to get their kids back in school and a glimmer of hope that the economy is recovering a large segment of the public is becoming irate at the nightly looting destruction and arson that no longer seem to have much to do with the may death of george floyd while in police custody where are the police the mayors and the governors to protect the vulnerable the law abiding and the small business owners biden knows the mercurial polls now tell him that he must permanently re emerge and cease being a virtual candidate yet he knows that if he does he risks losing the race so his surrogates talk of mandatory fact checking of the debates or even canceling them entirely former secretary of state hillary clinton recently said that biden should not concede under any circumstances apparently even if he loses the november election if the rules no longer favor biden then it seems time to change the rules so biden has become a tragic prisoner of his own paradoxes he is an old centrist who forged a faustian bargain with socialist bernie sanders and his hardcore leftist supporters that alliance was felt necessary to win the democratic nomination and the general election the hard left provided the urban fireworks this summer that seemed to drive down trump s poll numbers blue state governors and mayors contextualized the violence as a summer of love or largely peaceful until late last week biden stayed mum both because the polls suggested he should remain so and because he could hardly criticize those whose often violent acts were creating a sense of national anarchy under trump s presidency and thus undeniably aiding the biden candidacy but as cnn news anchor don lemon recently warned his fellow leftists now the polls are changing lemon apparently fears that the public is sick of seeing the urban unrest suddenly many members of the media want biden to condemn the rioting and violence but if biden did he might alienate his now critical left wing bernie base yet biden s continued reluctance to unequivocally fault the rioters and arsonists may be alienating moderate suburban swing voters the same paradox surrounds the debates should biden as promised debate trump yes but would he thereby blow up his candidacy in a moment of incoherence no but would he end up ridiculed in absentia like clint eastwood s empty chair at the republican convention trump never sits still so should biden match the president s frenzied pace and hold town halls impromptu interviews tarmac rallies photo ops on the campaign trail and daily unscripted press conferences but to do so could confirm to voters that he is frail and confused we saw some evidence of that danger in his aug address in pittsburgh after biden finally emerged from his basement he seemed confused about the covid death tally and could not quite follow his own teleprompter look the lives when you think about it more lives this year than any other year for the past years biden said few knew what he meant and when biden also claimed that he never opposed fracking his opponents came out almost immediately with past clips of him being critical of fracking and favoring the phasing out of fossil fuels how did biden become a prisoner of his own paradoxes perhaps he knew that he was not physically or cognitively up to running a real campaign but he ran all the same perhaps he knew that the violence of antifa and other agitators could eventually hurt more than help him but for months he kept silent about the violence all the same given the perceived political damage to trump perhaps he knew that he had always opposed the wacky agenda of sanders but biden wrongly felt he could pose as a moderate in yet if elected keep a promise to the socialists of the more radical wing of his party to govern as a leftist perhaps he knows that his new progressive allies would be happy for him to win them a presidency but even happier for him to then disappear as soon as possible paradoxes happen when what seems real is not and is known not to be real by those who act as if it is',\n"," 'the pandemic has dramatically increased the number of elderly new yorkers waiting for help from city funded agencies and it will be months before the residents get the services they need advocates say new data from liveon ny a senior advocacy group shows that the number of older big apple residents waiting to receive everything from personal care help to a lift to the supermarket has soared percent to people since february that figure fueled by coronavirus fears over venturing out and budget cuts comes from a survey completed by the non profit organizations contracted by the city s department for the aging to connect the elderly with needed services through case management liveon ny told the post it just seems to be growing exponentially allison nickerson liveon ny s executive director said of the wait for services it s catastrophic to people s lives you have a virus that specifically is affecting older new yorkers and there s been zero investment in trying to figure that out in fact there are cuts she said case management is the gateway to senior services and is designed to keep the elderly stabilized and safely living at home so they can stay out of nursing homes and hospitals which are bigger drains on public dollars and lead to a reduced quality of life providers say the difference between somebody who lives safely in their home or being forced to go into a nursing home could be simply that their bills are piling up and they don t know how to manage them said jonah gensler the associate executive director for community services at sunnyside community services one of the survey s respondents jolene boden sunnyside s case management program director said somebody could possibly have to leave their home and go to some kind of supportive housing because they can t change the linen on their bed and that s just mind boggling monserrate arteca of brooklyn is currently on a wait list through senior service provider riseboro community partnership to get help with such things as housekeeping and personal care i worry said arteca who lives in the williamsburg houses it s a lot of stress she had recently been waiting for a call from her doctor to fulfill a prescription only to realize her phone wasn t working and that s why she hadn t heard from them before the pandemic many older new yorkers such as arteca relied on their families or local community groups for help but those support systems have been stripped away making them more reliant on city funded services providers say in the city s fiscal year budget the city s department for the aging has been cut by million the agency has called the reduction modest and says it does not impact core dfta programs and there are no new needs in the executive budget records show the providers who spoke to the post said that is simply not the case the waiting list to get on our case management service list is higher than we ve ever seen it and that s because so many more seniors are homebound at this point said scott short the ceo of riseboro another one of the survey s respondents they can t get out and get to the senior centers they can t get out and get to their community groups get to the supermarket even and so while the demand for these services has ballooned the city has not responded with a corollary demand in allowing us to meet the need boden said her agency s case managers used to have an average caseload of to people and that it is now between and and there are still nearly people on their waiting list we need to have funding for more staff so that we can employ more case managers boden said the biggest need providers have come across involves food and while the city s ambitious getfood program has aimed to fill that need outside of the dfta senior providers say the program is imperfect at best there was a real lack of collaboration and coordination with the providers like riseboro who understood the needs of the seniors in communities and it led to a lot of inefficiency and waste in the system and a lot of low quality services and food making its way to the seniors in need short said joshua goodman a spokesman for the getfood program said in response that new yorkers can report any problems by calling or going to nyc gov getfoodhelp no new yorker should go hungry due to the pandemic we are delivering nearly million meals per day and while these are emergency meals they must meet strict guidelines about quality goodman said but as younger new yorkers venture back out into the city emboldened by record low infection rates the elderly are still stuck inside and their mental and physical health is rapidly deteriorating without services nickerson said many older new yorkers might not even be alive by the time they make it off the waitlist she added when it s a political priority the city finds money to do what it needs to do and it is obvious in this time to me that older new yorkers are not a priority because the city has not put resources or even talk behind this issue we re in this for the long haul and these are people s real lives these are our families ourselves and it s just really disturbing how it s not even part of the conversation the city department for the aging said in a statement to the post the city is in an unprecedented financial and public health crisis that has impacted all city agencies and their respective budgets amid these challenges dfta and its providers continue to serve older new yorkers with the same high quality programs and services while we have seen an increase in demand for services dfta s case management program is continuing to take on new clients everyone who calls to receive case management services receives an intake over the phone and is connected to available services and those with more urgent needs receive a full assessment older adults have been disproportionately impacted by covid we hope the federal government will provide additional support and resources needed at this time',\n"," 'it was the weekend of comebacks at the u

fifth set tiebreaker of a men s final austrian dominic thiem rallied from two sets down and an early break in the third to post a five set victory over german alexander zverev at empty arthur ashe stadium when it was over thiem and zverev two german speaking tour buddies broke the fortnight s social protocols slapping hands and embracing instead of tapping rackets as had been the coronavirus custom who could blame them we are really good friends thiem said we have a long term friendship we were both tested negative maybe times we didn t put anyone in danger we wanted to share the moment we just wanted to share the moment we didn t put anybody in danger it was the first time in years a five setter in a men s open final was won by a player who had been two sets down it s been known for a week there would be a first time men s grand slam champion after novak djokovic s disqualification that turned out to be thiem the second seed who came in with a record against his big serving friend but admitted he was pressing early i had a great career so far way better career than i could ever dreamt of but until today there was still a big part a big goal missing thiem said it finally ended with zverev pulling a backhand wide as the cramping austrian fell in joy onto his back i was so tight at the beginning said thiem who had been in three prior grand slam finals i wanted this title so much and of course there was also in my head that if i lose this one it s in grand slam finals we both didn t face one of the big that was in the back of the head for both of us that s why we were on nerves the classic men s final came one day after the women s final featured naomi osaka rallying from a horrifying first set to win her second women s crown the fifth set tiebreak matched the five set win by thiem over zverev in the australian open semifinals thiem also rallied from down in the fifth set with zverev serving for the match and in the fifth set tiebreaker thiem said he cramped up late but his mind outperformed his body zverev after playing in his first grand slam final choked up several times while receiving the runner up trophy having to pause for more than seconds to gather himself when he referred to his parents as important people missing in the crowd today for two sets thiem pounded his famous forehand deep and he looked oddly detached in his fourth grand slam final before settling in zverev started to show nerves late in the second set blowing a lead but he held on to take a two sets to none lead the momentum had shifted by then thiem reverted to his rock solid baseline form to become the first austrian to win a grand slam since tomas muster won the french open the comeback capped a successfully healthy if controversial open while the world s best player djokovic was disqualified it was not because of covid but for accidentally flicking a tennis ball that struck a female line judge in the neck no players tested positive for the coronavirus once the first ball was struck two weeks ago the flushing tennis center has come a long way since its turn as a harbor for covid patients in april as did new york city once the world s hot spot at the end we reflect back and say it s safe it s been good for tennis and it s been financially good for the players and the tennis ecosystem usta ceo michael dowse said the fifth set was a classic roller coaster thiem was up a break but double faulted to let zverev get the marathon back on serve with the german ultimately getting ahead one more comeback remained for thiem when he served for the match i was struggling physically but i also thought that he is not the freshest anymore thiem said the belief was stronger than the body',\n"," 'what are we doing living in new york city continues to feel

to flatten the curves we needed to stop the hospitals from getting overwhelmed those were worthwhile goals what are the goals now it s insane to keep children locked down without a goal and the insanity doesn t end there last week gov cuomo announced that finally restaurants in gotham could reopen for indoor dining but at an absurd percent capacity a friend with a seat brooklyn joint pointed out she could host people the rest of the state has been open for indoor dining throughout the summer at percent capacity yet we didn t experience any spikes in cases why is cuo mo punishing big apple restaurateurs and workers the irrationality is the most infuriating part a few days ago an announcement was made that public high schools in new york are canceling their football volleyball and cheerleading fall seasons but tennis soccer and field hockey are somehow allowed huh that s so arbitrary i tried to not be overly bitter last week as photos of my friends kids returning to real schools filled my facebook feed they weren t going back to school in far off places plenty were returning to full time in person schooling at public schools in nearby long island and private ones in manhattan my own kids won t go back to any schooling until later this week when city public schools will finally start remotely do private school and suburban parents want teachers and kids to die no all have weighed the risks and benefits taken the necessary precautions and decided that it s unhealthier to remove kids from live education long term new york city schools are supposed to be returning to part time in person learning on sept but few parents believe it will actually happen mostly due to the total incompetence of everyone in charge of the reopening the mixed messages from the top and the cravenness of teachers unions during routine covid testing last week two asymptomatic teachers tested positive in brooklyn the schools where they teach will now be delayed in opening did no one who makes policy foresee that we would have positive cases going forward is the plan simply to shut down schools every time there is a positive case and are we doing that until covid disappears we didn t sign up to stay home indefinitely i m not an epidemiologist and i will largely follow what actual medical professionals direct us to do but few epidemiologists are urging a continued lockdown to defeat covid writing in the new york times in april gabriel leung an infectious disease epidemiologist and dean of medicine at the university of hong kong wrote that lockdowns can t last forever with out causing enormous damage to economies and compromising peoples goodwill and emotional well being but more important leung noted containment has failed everywhere as we ve seen spikes in countries like australia and south korea previously considered model countries that handled the virus very well that s more important to remember than ever we can t defeat covid by continually shutting down i ve taken covid seriously both in this column and in my own family but the strategy for new york simply makes no sense anymore we need a longer term direction for our city and state and that direction should be based on science real science not science wielded as a rhetorical cudgel by cuomo and de blasio we can t continue in this fearfulness with a vague plan to wait out the virus while society collapses around us our elected officials need to offer rational guidance or new yorkers need to fight them we ve been complacent for long enough',\n"," 'white house trade

despite comments trump made in an interview with bob woodward that he intentionally downplayed the virus the trump ally pointed out that the president acted early to ban travel from china and ramped up production of medical equipment for hospital workers while not trying to panic americans and cause chaos tapper pressed navarro why the president wasn t being straightforward with the american people he was straightforward navarro responded no he wasn t the cnn host countered there was look look jake jake i m telling you what our strategy is navarro said just answer the it s a very basic question tapper said you want to talk about what you want to talk about ok navarro accused tapper of cherry picking after several more minutes of back and forth navarro said trump had prepared the administration for the steps it needed to take the answer is in february all the way through the middle of march when the world health organization finally said there was a pandemic and china was hiding the information finally that s when we knew that there was a pandemic he said and you know what jake we were at that point prepared for the worst navarro noted that by then the white house had personal protection equipment ready as well as testing and vaccine development he later added that tapper and cnn were not honest with the american people moments later tapper thanked navarro for the interview and abruptly cut away even as the white house adviser repeating i answered the question i would just like to remind the american people watching that the united states has less than percent of the world s population and the united states has more than percent of the world s coronavirus deaths that is a fact it does not matter how many times he insults cnn tapper said at the end of the segment critics pounced on a series of recorded interviews trump gave woodward for his book rage out tuesday to attack the president s handling of the pandemic in the interviews trump acknowledged he

say america s been attacked by terrorists everyone panic they created a plan and they presented calm and certainty in a difficult time mcdaniel said what s different this time is democrats are

shutdown began i had people scheduled to start and four business days to turn a five day orientation into a virtual experience said mackenzie egan a talent development specialist at holmdel nj based hiring platform icims not only that but she also had to ensure that their computers were loaded with all of the right software tools and credentials and delivered to their homes prior to their first day i was a little nervous about pulling it off said egan that s no wonder because the stakes are high according to jobvite s job seeker nation survey almost one third of workers quit their jobs within the first days that translates into thousands of lost recruiting dollars but according to human resources consultant and speaker laurie ruettimann onboarding helps workers attach to the organization and to fall in love with the culture so that down the road when the employer asks for a little extra they say yes and don t quit it s one of the reasons that before covid icims flew in new associates from all over the world this is when they learn about our core values accountability adaptability customer commitment drive empathy kaizen passion and transparency egan said whether that mesh could occur with new employees sitting at a kitchen table instead of a conference room no one knew egan spent more than one late night making sure that the new virtual format was engaging relayed the same information and was fun her efforts were worthwhile according to adam koster icims incoming senior manager of marketing technology who joined the company in mid march at first i was disappointed that i wasn t going to have a chance to meet everyone and start building relationships in person he said but between presentations made by company leaders on zoom functional training and opportunities to socialize with his onboarding cohort and bond koster gives egan high marks he is especially keen on the games that they played there was a virtual show and tell where participants were asked to present an object that revealed something about them it was like being in kindergarten again laughed koster who showed his classmates a note that his youngest son had left on his pillow good luck on your first day at your new job dad it said consequently onboarding was welcoming informative and a blast koster said chelsea lee a people development manager at cockroach labs worried that the incoming class of roachers a nickname for the company s employees might have a horrible experience onboarding virtually peter guagenti cockroach labs incoming chief marketing officer was supposed to fly in from san francisco but covid took that off the table i was really looking forward to meeting the team he said the box of company swag a t shirt stickers a water bottle and a coffee cup provided some comfort guagenti used them to decorate his home office members of cockroach labs executive team like vice president of product marketing jim walker signed on to google meet to talk about the company he gave a one hour talk about the market the company is in and the great opportunity that was ahead of them all this is the first time we ve done onboarding during a global pandemic said walker noting that there may be advantages in doing it this way i really thought it was going to be a struggle but everyone was engaged there were fewer distractions i walked away happy guagenti agreed it s better than being trapped in one room he said adding that there was time in his schedule to check in on his daughter s schoolwork there was also an activity doughnut pairings that lee had arranged where two or more new hires are assigned to a virtual breakout room just to chat we got to know each other as people people whose spouses might have recently lost their jobs or their child

onboarding package socks notebooks stickers came a stipend for setting up a home workspace not only that but the newcomers also received welcome messages from current employees via slack on day the

staff just three days before snagging coronavirus relief funds meant to help the firm preserve jobs the post has learned san francisco based welkin health laid off of its roughly employees on april as the covid crisis sapped sales according to three sources with knowledge of the matter three days later the health care software provider was approved for at least million from the paycheck protection program according to federal data a forgivable loan meant to help small businesses keep people employed or rehire laid off workers the april layoffs left welkin with just about employees sources said despite the company indicating to the small business administration that it had staffers the data show the cuts that welkin made before learning whether it had access to the job saving cash go against the spirit of the billion program created to protect workers during a historic economic crisis says government watchdog liz hempowicz the point wasn t so that businesses could continue to exist on paper or in a bank account hempowicz director of public policy at the nonpartisan project on government oversight told the post it was so that people remained employed during this time of great economic instability the practical effect here is that there s less money in this program to go to those small businesses that do have those employees still working there she said welkin has raised some million from deep pocketed investors in recent years including from thrive capital a venture fund run by kushner the husband of supermodel karlie kloss and younger brother of white house adviser jared kushner as the post has previously reported thrive urged portfolio companies including welkin to stay away from the ppp program meant for for the smallest most vulnerable businesses in our communities these loans are less obviously for the startup with a host of institutional investors and several years of cash in the bank looking to extend runway thrive wrote in an april e mail to startups that sought the fund s advice on the ppp funds but welkin defied thrive s advice and blamed the april layoffs on the pandemic drying up its sales pipeline sources said now sources say the layoffs could force the silicon valley company to pay back some of the loan instead of having it forgiven companies that receive ppp money are supposed to spend percent of it on payroll costs in order for the feds to convert the loan into a grant it could be tough for welkin to clear that bar said hempowicz because it s impossible to pay people who ve been axed and while ppp recipients have until dec to rehire or replace laid off workers and qualify for full loan forgiveness welkin doesn t appear to have made any headway several staffers have resigned since the layoffs leaving the company with about current employees sources said welkin s web site had only one job listing as of friday in response to the post s reporting welkin ceo michelle pampin said the company moved forward with the loan after careful legal review to confirm our eligibility as well as our review of the intent of the program in supporting small businesses pampin also said many data points and statements the post presented were inaccurate but did not elaborate welkin also axed roughly a dozen people a month prior to the covid layoffs on march after losing its largest customer in february to a competitor

other businesses and israelis will face restrictions on movement and on gatherings our goal is to stop the increase in cases and lower morbidity netanyahu said in a nationally broadcast statement i know that these steps come at a difficult price for all of us this is not the holiday we are used to the tightening of measures marks the second time israel is being plunged into a lockdown after a lengthy shutdown in the spring that lockdown is credited with having brought down what were much lower infection numbers but it wreaked havoc on the country s economy sending unemployment skyrocketing the lockdown will remain in place for at least three weeks at which point officials may relax measures if numbers are seen declining israelis typically hold large family gatherings and pack synagogues during the important fast of yom kippur later this month settings that officials feared could trigger new outbreaks a sticking point in government deliberations over the lockdown was what prayers would look like during the holidays while the details on prayer during the lockdown were not nailed down in the government decision what were expected to be strict limits on the faithful that prompted

allowing the virus to spread unchecked much of that criticism has been aimed at netanyahu who has faced a public outcry over his handling of the crisis and has seen thousands of protesters descend on his jerusalem residence every week while lauded for his decisive response following the spring outbreak netanyahu appeared distracted by politics and personal matters including his trial for corruption allegations as infections rose over the summer netanyahu has also been lambasted for seeming to cave to pressure from various interest groups including most recently his ultra orthodox

topics that hit home were racial profiling when it comes to policing with unarmed blacks three times likelier to be killed by police than whites that reality hits home for nets players and they

new york faces a revenue loss between million to billion for the academic year due to covid s impact on enrollment and other costs to keep campuses safe a suny spokesperson said the campus president at the state university at albany sent a sept memo to his administration and faculty saying the campus is grappling with a million deficit and that he anticipates the cut in state operating assistance this year we have been informed to expect a cut in state funding this year which is an million loss while reductions to state support are not yet official we need to plan for these now as our one time cash reserves are being expended in their entirety this year said suny albany president havidan rodriguez rodriguez said the school has instituted budget reduction targets for all divisions and imposed a freeze on hiring and all but essential spending to generate million in savings he will tap into cash reserves to cover the rest of the shortfall one problem albany u has encountered during the pandemic is plummeting enrollment from out of state and international students unlike new york state residents international students and out of state students are not eligible for state tuition relief and therefore pay most if not all of the sticker price for tuition and dorm costs that run roughly per semester a big source of revenue gov andrew cuomo has imposed a travel advisory and a mandatory two week quarantine on visitors to new york who hail from other states with rising coronavirus infection rates to prevent outbreaks here which may have also impacted enrollment this year we are seeing a drop in out of state and a decrease in international students this represents a tremendous loss for our campus diversity as well as creating a million shortfall the president s memo said consequently the number of students living in higher cost campus dorms has also cratered during the pandemic rodriguez said the number of students living on campus this fall is approximately or of capacity the lost housing revenue is million relative to what we planned for in our budget the significant decline in on campus student residents will also impact other operations e g dining retail

we have been told to expect a cut in state funding this year or million we also have been informed that our allocation for last year was retroactively cut to the tune of million it is unclear when if ever our funding will return to current levels let alone the levels of support we would ideally receive as a top research institution in the region she reported that stony brook has projected a million shortfall for the current school much of it tied to added covid costs for its state supported hospital and medical school which were busy treating coronavirus patients mcinnis sent a follow up notice last thursday saying she has appointed five different budget study groups to realign stony brook s finances for the long term in her previous notice she also suggested declining support from the state and the legislature s resistance to raising tuition limits the research university s options an education at stony brook is remarkably affordable for a top research institution while this is helpful for our families there are consequences to having almost the lowest tuition in the aau association of american universities increasingly our dual commitments of affordability and excellence are becoming difficult to balance without robust state support or cohort level tuition she said absent additional emergency federal aid a suny administration spokesperson said the campus school as a

hidden in the white house the last five months a president under quarantine cowering from the chinese virus the symbolism would have been disastrous for the mightiest nation on the planet trump had to show fearlessness in the face of the virus house speaker nancy pelosi last week called his refusal to kowtow to the coronavirus a brazen invitation to get sick but as the president told his old friend rudy giuliani on saturday afternoon he took the risks he had to take because great generals do not lead from behind they get out front and motivate the troops he was speaking to the former big apple mayor by phone from his hospital room at walter reed medical center where he was flown by helicopter after his oxygen levels began to fall i knew there was a risk that i could catch the virus but if i couldn t accept that risk i should resign i am the president of the united states i can t lock myself in a room i had to confront it so the american people stopped being afraid of it so we could deal with it responsibly i couldn t hide in the white house if i had handled it any other way i would have created more panic more fear in the american people i m going to beat this then i will be able to show people we can deal with this disease responsibly but we shouldn t be afraid of it giuliani widely praised for his leadership during the sept terrorist attacks knows a thing or two about leadership his staff urged him to retreat to safety in brooklyn after the twin towers were attacked but instead he went straight to ground zero you can only lead from the front he says trump reiterated the message saturday night in a four minute video from walter reed this is america this is the united states this is the most powerful country in the world i can t be locked up in a room as a leader you have to confront problems the fact is that a president doing his job and running for re election necessarily is in contact with thousands of people it s not surprising he would contract the highly infectious coronavirus regardless of precautions biden s timid behavior is not a model for how a president needs to behave the obsessive measures taken to protect the year old border on fetishistic with elaborate social distancing circles taped on the ground and masks at paces staff yell keep back and six feet if this was your grandfather you would appreciate the caution but a president can t be paralyzed by fear and neither can the country the virus is no longer a death sentence treatments have been found the fatality rate has plummeted and vaccines are on the horizon for political advantage democrats have tried to keep americans scared depressed and under house arrest while blaming the president for every covid death sensible americans reject this perverse framing of the pandemic maybe the basement option works for those in the media and protected classes who have jobs that allow them to sit at home and conduct business via zoom but in order for them to eat and have their groceries delivered somebody had to get out in the real world and risk the virus those scolding the president and his supporters tut tutting about masks and social distancing are sacrificing the welfare of children and young people who are least at risk for some being cooped up inside is a death sentence worse than the virus we will see how the president and overweight pulls through but the signs are good say his doctors and he could be released from the hospital in the next couple of days trump adapted to the virus his rallies became open air events at airports around the country with the theatrical backdrop of air force one gleaming splendidly under klieg lights at his last rally saturday night at the harrisburg airport in pennsylvania he stood out in the rain valiantly performing in his wet suit for two hours the cheers were even more ecstatic than i remembered at his old indoor rallies with a new chant of we love you i love the man because he cares about this country and he fights for us said attendee teresa tavoletti a self described something suburban woman who had driven from new jersey i don t care how he speaks i don t care what he says i care about his actions and his actions have proven it to me he s got a record now to prove that he cares i heard the same from people across the crucial swing state of pennsylvania i saw it in weirton west virginia last weekend at a gathering of trump supporters in a trump train a parade of vehicles and trucks waving trump flags he supports my livelihood which is oil and natural gas said jason laster of wellsburg west virginia he supports the right to bear arms i just feel like he s done great things for the country already and four more years if we can get pelosi to quit trying to impeach him then i feel like he s going to do a bunch more great things you see the enthusiasm for the president outside walter reed where stalwarts have gathered to wave flags outside his window and cars honk their horns in appreciation you see it in new voter registrations from florida to pennsylvania and west virginia where republicans are outstripping democrats by as much as two to one if the president bounces back onto the campaign trail he will be an invincible hero who not only survived every dirty trick the democrats threw at him but the chinese virus as well he will show america we no longer

oxygen levels i think his statement was misconstrued what he meant was that hours ago when he and i were checking on the president that there was that momentary episode of the high fever and that

magic theories of market capitalism have failed and that the world needs a new type of politics that promotes dialogue and solidarity and rejects war at all costs francis on sunday laid out his vision for a post covid world by uniting the core elements of his social teachings into a new encyclical fratelli tutti brothers all which was released on the feast day of his namesake the peace loving st francis of assisi the document draws its inspiration from the teachings of st francis and the pope s previous preaching on the injustices of the global economy and its destruction of the planet and pairs them with his call for greater human solidarity to address today s problems in the encyclical francis rejected even the catholic church s own doctrine justifying war as a means of legitimate defense saying it had been too broadly applied over the centuries and was no longer viable it is very difficult nowadays to invoke the rational criteria elaborated in earlier centuries to speak of the possibility of a just war francis wrote in the most controversial new element of the encyclical francis had started writing the encyclical the third of his pontificate before the coronavirus struck and upended everything from the global economy to everyday life he said the pandemic however had confirmed his belief that current political and economic institutions must be reformed to address the legitimate needs of the people most harmed by the coronavirus aside from the differing ways that various countries responded to the crisis their inability to work together became quite evident francis wrote anyone who thinks that the only lesson to be learned was the need to improve what we were already doing or to refine existing systems and regulations is denying reality he cited the grave loss of millions of jobs as a result of the virus as evidence of the need for politicians to listen to popular movements unions and marginalized groups and to craft more just social and economic policies the fragility of world systems in the face of the pandemic has demonstrated that not everything can be resolved by market freedom he wrote it is imperative to have a proactive economic policy directed at promoting an economy that favors productive diversity and business creativity and makes it possible for jobs to be created and not cut he denounced populist politics that seek to demonize and isolate and called for a culture of encounter that promotes dialogue solidarity and a sincere effort at working for the common good as an outgrowth of that francis repeated his criticism of the perverse global economic system which he said consistently keeps the poor on the margins while enriching the few francis rejected the concept of an absolute right to property for individuals stressing instead the social purpose and common good that must come from sharing the earth s resources francis once again rejected trickle down economic theory as he did in the first major mission statement of his papacy the evangelii gaudium the joy of the gospel saying it simply doesn t achieve what it claims neo liberalism simply reproduces itself by resorting to magic theories of spillover or trickle without using the name as the only solution to societal problems he wrote there is little appreciation of the fact that the alleged spillover does not resolve the inequality that gives rise to new forms of violence threatening the fabric of society much of the new encyclical repeats francis well known preaching about the need to welcome and value migrants and his rejection of the nationalistic isolationist policies of many of today s political leaders he dedicated an entire chapter to the parable of the good samaritan saying its lesson of charity kindness and looking out for strangers was

wouldn t be in they suspect if they were part of the company s inner circle of hasidic jewish staffers who they say get special treatment they definitely used covid as a cover to eliminate some of us said dan wagner a nearly six year veteran of the famed new york tech retailer which is known for its conveyor belt system of moving merchandise around its three story megastore on west th street and ninth avenue wagner a professional photographer who worked as a product description writer for b h says he believes he has not been asked back to work after he raised a fuss in march about the daily prayer services which took place in the company s lunch rooms i told hr that people shouldn t congregate wagner said adding that b h later announced in a newsletter that two workers who had attended the prayers had died from the virus in late march wagner also repeatedly pressed b h for information after learning that a fellow staffer on another floor had contracted the virus he said i believe they retaliated against me for simply asking whether i was in close contact with someone with covid william cannon also a b h content writer says he believes he isn t being brought back because he asked for permission to work from home in march i told hr that i don t feel safe at the office leaving in the packed elevators and working so close to others cannon said cannon who is diabetic was also unnerved by the prayer services because they were held in the same rooms where he kept his insulin which needs to be refrigerated there were people packed in there and i d have to step over them to get to the refrigerator he said it was uncomfortable for me b h told cannon to use his paid time off until it came up with a work from home plan which it did about a week later b h was very slow to

forced to share insulin with his diabetic uncle with whom he lives then in august after months of no communication from the company cannon saw an indeed com posting for a mobile tech consumer writer for b h which was what he did for the company the posting also called for gaming expertise which cannon says his manager knows he possesses i took this as their way of getting rid of the people they didn t want he said of the job posting it was so sudden with no followups it seemed like a way to lay people off without telling them they were laid off wagner meanwhile saw two listings for his job as photography writer on the company s web site most recently on oct b h has not told the men either way what its plans are and they have not asked but the megastore reopened to walk ins on july after

says he filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission alleging that b h discriminates against non hasidic employees cannon who is african american said he too is considering

herman schreiber opened in declined to comment on the job listings or wagner s discrimination complaint except to say that it welcomes the eeoc s findings b h was one of the last retailers to furlough

thousands of vulnerable people in new york nursing homes it s bad enough that he wrote a shameful book praising himself for his pandemic response and now is doing a victory lap of self congratulation in the worst hit state in the nation it s bad enough that he is mounting a pre election scare campaign on covid vaccines to stir up anti vax sentiment for political purposes but now we discover that cuomo got campaign funds from the hospital organizations that lobbied for his lethal policy for the elderly and which then bought tv ads whitewashing his culpability an exclusive audit of campaign donations to cuomo by openthebooks com shows disturbing links with industry bodies which demanded the disastrous order forcing nursing homes to admit covid infected patients hospitals didn t want overall the audit shows a systematic pay to play culture in albany says adam andrzejewski ceo of openthebooks com a nonprofit which has compiled a comprehensive database of us public sector expenditures the pattern of patronage in new york state amounts to a legalized money laundering scheme aimed at monetizing incumbent political power cuomo has received million since from companies who then made billion from state contracts did the governor operate in his own political interest or the public interest asks andrzejewski who provided his data exclusively to the post soliciting state vendors for campaign cash is highly unethical because each instance where a state vendor gave a campaign donation and received a state contract is a potential conflict of interest most disturbing is million in donations from the greater new york hospital association to the governor s re election campaign in plus other generous in kind support the association and the health care workers union seiu also spent million lobbying in albany in a few days before the election cuomo approved a multibillion dollar medicaid rate hike for hospitals and nursing homes which the association had lobbied for and which allowed them to settle a pay dispute with the union then in february cuomo appointed association board member and northwell health ceo michael dowling and union president dennis rivera to co chair the medicaid redesign team dowling donated to cuomo six weeks before the appointment while the union gave northwell health received million in state payments in reports andrzejewski when the pandemic hit in march the association successfully lobbied the cuomo administration to transfer covid positive patients to nursing homes to relieve pressure on hospitals despite warnings from doctors that the move represented a clear and present danger to other nursing home residents cuomo issued his directive march while federally provided beds in the javits center and usns comfort hospital ship mainly lay empty as we now know the directive was a death sentence for an estimated nursing home residents with the move proving to be a legal and public relations nightmare the association again struck gold when it lobbied for a budget provision limiting the ability of covid victims to file malpractice suits against hospitals and nursing homes well satisfied with its investment in the governor the association then spent millions on tv advertising that praised cuomo s management of the pandemic you could call the ads a quid pro cuomo cuomo s senior adviser rich azzopardi told openthebooks com that agency contracting is done at arm s length from the governor on the merits by career civil servants and procurement professionals with no input or influence from the executive chamber and generally through a competitive bidding process but the pattern of political patronage for campaign cash which andrzejewski has uncovered in the hospital sector is repeated elsewhere across new york as you can see it s a cozy arrangement which benefits cuomo but it will only add to the growing unease new yorkers have with their sky high taxes shoddy services and self interested politicians get ready for the mother of all scare campaigns from democrats and their media allies the next two weeks they ll tell you the coronavirus is on the rampage and it s all president trump s fault but before we fall for the fearmongering of joe biden s dark winter it s worth noting that the cdc says flu numbers are down percent have masks stopped it or are flu symptoms being conflated with covid secondly the university of washington model used to forecast impending doom has been getting it drastically wrong since march finally the mortality rate for covid patients is plummeting as better treatments appear one study of patients in the nyu langone health system to be published in the journal of hospital medicine finds death rates between march and august dropped percentage points even for the elderly be not afraid be sensible among the most stubborn myths around the burisma scandal is that ukraine s top prosecutor viktor shokin was not investigating the corrupt energy company at the time joe biden threatened to withhold billion in aid unless he was fired the washington post repeated the false claim last week but contemporaneous news sources from ukraine show that shokin was aggressively pursuing burisma in while it was paying the then vice president s wayward son hunter biden more than a month to sit on its board on feb interfax ukraine reported that prosecutor general shokin had seized property belonging to hunter s boss burisma owner mykola zlochevsky including four large houses two plots of land and a rolls royce phantom car the national radio co of ukraine reported the same eight days later joe biden phoned ukraine s president petro poroshenko four days after the call shokin was fired although it took another month for the ukrainian parliament to ratify his ousting',\n"," 'attacks on president trump s performance on covid are central to joe biden s campaign notes roger d klein at city journal and those attacks along with the media s continual faultfinding have influenced voter opinion but they re unjustified and unwarranted yes the fda s initial overregulation and the centers for disease control s early underperformance made trump a ready target but the president s targeted regulatory relief and financial incentives stimulated an unprecedented private sector response to the pandemic more than compensating crucially operation warp speed is compressing the usual new vaccine implementation time from over ten years to a matter of months and states that heeded trump s advice to reopen quickly have seen proportionally

to retreat under a barrage of oink noises and cries of nazis with activists screaming through megaphones about how much the officers children would hate their fathers they have now pulled down almost every statue and public monument in the city and the few businesses still open operate as in a city under siege joe biden paradoxically wants to help small businesses by raising their labor costs with a minimum wage hike from to an hour observes reason s christian britschgi most studies find a correlation between a higher minimum wage and higher unemployment rates or fewer working hours so it ll likely hurt workers too it s a bit of a mystery how biden could think small businesses already coping with massive declines in revenue and increased operating costs would benefit from having their labor get more expensive in thursday s debate biden said struggling businesses should get more money from congress britschgi snarks that if he has his way on the minimum wage they ll need all the assistance they can get when you take a clear eyed look at biden there is no meaningful case for his candidacy argues lisa boothe at the hill the post s reporting about hunter biden s business dealings calls into question the good guy fa ade on which the biden campaign is based his record on racial justice has been widely criticized by democrats and others and his call for national civility is overshadowed by his behavior as a senator leading two of the most vitriolic destructive supreme court confirmation hearings for judge robert bork and justice clarence thomas and his constant flip flopping means voters have no reason to trust biden on policies either while the president certainly has his own faults you always know where he stands and what he believes what s the case for biden at realclearpolitics stephen moore argues that despite joe biden s claims there s nothing centrist in his economic plan though polls show most voters believe president trump would be better for the economy many also think uncle joe s economic plan is relatively harmless and won t endanger jobs paychecks or retirement savings wrong moore cites several of biden s economic deadly sins a trillion tax hike ending right to work laws and us energy independence and imposing a minimum wage that will destroy millions of jobs for young people and low skilled workers many economists worry that under

furloughed due to covid and recently offered her job back remarkable on many levels you are wondering if since the scientists say older people are more at risk employers can use that as an excuse to discriminate on the basis of age it would be a novel rationale that they are declining to hire you for your own safety no matter how you slice it that is an adverse employment decision based on age and the law doesn t allow it don t let your age be a psychological obstacle for you just apply to every job that interests you with confidence and enthusiasm many employers actually prefer older
